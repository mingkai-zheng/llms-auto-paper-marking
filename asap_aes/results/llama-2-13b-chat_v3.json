You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immediately go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we can't see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much...\n\nBased on the rubric, I will evaluate the student's response point by point.\n\n1. An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\nThe student's response is somewhat confusing, as it seems to take a position (that computers have both positive and negative effects) but does not provide any sufficient support for this claim.

This point is partially fulfilled.\n\nSCORE: 4/6\n\n5. A developed response that takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is somewhat developed, as it takes a clear position on the effects of computers and provides some reasons to support this position.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you.

Expert @PERSON1 states \"@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts.\" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years.

She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future.

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",
        "marker": " Sure! Here's my detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nFirstly, I'll address the positives. The student has taken a clear position on the effects of computers on people, arguing that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. They have also provided some thoughtful details to support their position, such as the potential for cyberbullying, the distraction of online content, and the risk of identity theft. Additionally, the student has shown a basic understanding of organization and sentence structure, making the response relatively easy to read.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, there are several areas for improvement. Firstly, the response lacks sophistication and nuance. The student has relied too heavily on generalizations and list-like details, without providing sufficient elaboration or specific examples. For instance, the statement \"cyber bullying\" is mentioned, but there is no explanation of what this means or how it can affect individuals. Furthermore, the student's argument is marred by grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, which can detract from the overall effectiveness of the response. (For example, the sentence \"Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying.\")\n\nFurthermore, the student has not adequately considered counterarguments or alternative perspectives. For instance, while they acknowledge that computers can provide hand-eye coordination and access to information, they do not provide any explanation of how these benefits might outweigh the potential drawbacks. Additionally, the student's response does not address any potential consequences of limiting computer use, such as the impact on educational opportunities or career advancement.\n\nIn terms of the rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\nScore Point 2: An under-developed response that may or may not take a position. Typical elements:\n1. Contains only general reasons with unelaborated and/or list-like details.\n2. Shows little or no evidence of organization.\n3. May be awkward and confused or simplistic.\n4. May show little awareness of audience.\n\nWhile the student has taken a position and provided some supporting details, the response is largely under-developed and lacks sophistication. The lack of specific examples, elaboration, and counterarguments (as well as the presence of grammatical errors) all contribute to a lower score.\n\nSCORE: 2/6.",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

Use of Evidence (1 point):\nThe student rarely uses evidence to support their claims, and when they do, it is not well-integrated into the response. The student mostly relies on general statements and unelaborated reasons, without providing specific examples or data to back up their claims.\n\nRationale: Score 1 out of 1.\n\n5. Persuasiveness (1 point):\nThe student's response is not persuasive and does not effectively convey their position to the reader. The response lacks conviction and passion, and the student does not use any persuasive language or rhetorical devices to make their arguments more compelling.\n\nRationale: Score 1 out of 1.\n\nTotal Score: 3/6\n\nOverall, the student's response is undeveloped and lacks depth, organization, and persuasiveness. While the student attempts to address the question, the response is largely incomplete and fails to provide specific examples or evidence to support their claims. The student should work on developing a clear and persuasive argument, integrating evidence to support their claims, and using more sophisticated language and transitional phrases to connect their ideas.",

        "essay": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He takes pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictitious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage.\"\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I will assess the student's response as follows:\n\nScore 2: The response demonstrates a partial or literal understanding of the text.\n\nThe student's answer addresses some of the demands of the question, but does not fully develop all parts equally. For example, the student mentions the advisirt from old men, but does not explain how this setting feature affects the cyclist. Additionally, the student mentions the sun beating down on the cyclist, but does not clarify how this affects the cyclist's journey.\n\nThe student does use some expressed or implied information from the text to demonstrate understanding, such as the imaginary setting of a fictitious stream. However, the student does not clarify or extend understanding beyond the literal, as there is no analysis of how these features affect the cyclist's journey.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 2 to the student's response. This score reflects the partial or literal understanding of the text demonstrated in the student's answer.\n\nSCORE: 2/3\n\nI hope this evaluation helps you in assessing the student's response.

The student does a good job of identifying some of the challenges faced by the cyclist in the story, such as the heat, abandoned roads, and snakes. They also correctly note that the cyclist's decision to follow the old men's advice led to negative consequences.\n\nHowever, there are several areas where the response falls short. First, the student's explanation of how the heat and abandoned roads affected the cyclist is rather straightforward and lacks depth. For example, they could have elaborated on how the heat caused the cyclist to become dehydrated, or discussed how the abandoned roads made the cyclist doubt his route.\n\nAdditionally, the student's explanation of the snake's impact on the story is cursory and does not fully connect to the broader themes of the text.

Uses expressed and implied information from the text: The response uses some information from the text, such as the description of the setting and the cyclist's thirst, but it could have incorporated more details.\n3. Clarifies and extends understanding beyond the literal: The response does not fully extend the understanding beyond the literal. It mainly focuses on the setting's harsh conditions and the cyclist's struggles.\n\nThe student's response highlights the following features of the setting that affect the cyclist:\n\n* Dry and hot conditions: \"The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.\"\n* No water: \"wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.\"\n* Desert-like setting: \"tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.\"\n* Hills and rough terrain: \"over one long, crippling hill.\"\n\nHowever, the response could have been more detailed and comprehensive in discussing the setting's impact on the cyclist. For example, the response could have explored how the heat and lack of water affected the cyclist's physical condition, or how the isolated and desolate setting contributed to the cyclist's feelings of hopelessness.\n\nAdditionally, the response could have been more cohesive and focused. Some sentences are fragmented or lack connection to the main points. For instance, the introduction of the snake feels disconnected from the rest of the response.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the text and the setting's impact on the cyclist.

However, the student then writes that the mood is \"always happy\" and \"never about what is bad in his life.\" This is an overstatement, as the author does mention some challenges and hardships, such as the struggle to adapt to a new country and the lack of knowledge of the language and culture.

This is a good start, as it shows that the student has understood the tone of the passage.\n2. The student then provides specific examples from the passage to support their answer. For instance, they mention how the author's parents welcomed other refugees into their home and celebrated their arrival, showing the spirit of generosity and love that permeates the passage.\n3.

The response includes limited information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations. Here are the areas where the student's response is lacking:\n\n1. Limited information: The student's response only touches upon a few aspects of the mood created by the author, such as the satisfaction and love for Cuba, but neglects to address other important aspects like the sense of community, the importance of family, and the struggles faced by the author's parents.\n2. Misinterpretations: The student mentions that the author's parents took \"a tough transitien\" to move to the United States, which is not accurately represented in the memoir. The author's parents actually faced cultural hardships and struggled financially, but there is no mention of a \"tough transitien.\"\n3.

The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone.

This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction.

However, the response is still mostly clear and complete, so I would not deduct more than one point for this.\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes limited information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nIf I were to deduct more points, it would be for the limited information provided about the second obstacle (violent air currents). The student simply states that \"violent air currents were present in and around New York City,\" without providing any specific examples or details from the excerpt. This makes the response feel incomplete and lacking in evidence to support the claim.\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes little or no information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nIf the student had provided even less information or had included misinterpretations of the text, I would deduct more points. However, since the response is still mostly clear and complete, I would not deduct more than one point.\n\nScore: 3/4\n\nOverall, the student's response is a strong answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the text. The only areas for improvement are providing more specific information about the third obstacle and including more details about the second obstacle to make the response feel more complete.",

Here's my detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response, along with my rationale for the grade I assign.\n\nIdeas (Score 4/6):\nThe student's story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, but the ideas could be more thoroughly developed with specific, relevant details. For example, the student could have described the feelings of excitement and anticipation while waiting in line for the roller coaster, or the sense of accomplishment after finally riding it. Additionally, the student could have explored more nuanced aspects of patience, such as the ability to tolerate frustration or disappointment.\n\nOrganization (Score 2/3):\nThe organization of the student's story is logically sequenced, but there is room for improvement in terms of cohesion and flow. The student could have used more transition phrases and sentence connections to tie the paragraphs together and create a smoother reading experience. Additionally, the student could have incorporated more specific details to support the main ideas, which could have made the story feel more developed and substantial.\n\nStyle (Score 2/3):\nThe student's command of language is adequate, but there is room for improvement in terms of varied sentence structure and compelling word choice. The student could have used more descriptive adjectives and verbs to bring the story to life, and varied sentence structure to create a more engaging rhythm. Additionally, the student could have paid closer attention to sentence-level conventions, such as punctuation and capitalization, to ensure accuracy and clarity.\n\nConventions (Score 2/3):\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but there are some errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation that need to be addressed. For example, the student uses the word \"yay\" and \"omg\" in the story, which are informal and somewhat inappropriate for a formal essay. Additionally, there are a few instances of incorrect capitalization and punctuation, such as missing commas and inconsistent use of quotation marks.\n\nOverall, I would score this response as a 9/15. The student has some good ideas and a logical sequence of events, but could benefit from more specific details, varied sentence structure, and closer attention to conventions.

I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you assess and grade the student's answer! Here's a detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response, along with my rationale for the grade I assign, referenced against the provided rubric.\n\nIdeas (6 points):\n\nThe student tells a story with ideas that are somewhat focused on the topic of patience. The story is about a time when the student had to be patient while waiting for their turn to play a video game. The story is developed with a mix of specific and general details, such as the student's age and the location where they lived. However, the story is not thoroughly developed, as there are some gaps in the narrative and the student does not fully explore the concept of patience.\n\nScore: 4/6\n\nOrganization (3 points):\n\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the connections between ideas and events are not always clear, and the transitions between paragraphs are somewhat abrupt. The student could benefit from more cohesive connecting words and phrases to improve the flow of the narrative.\n\nScore: 2/3\n\nStyle (3 points):\n\nThe student's command of language is adequate but not outstanding. The word choice is generally precise, but there are some instances of generalized vocabulary (e.g., \"really sad\" instead of \"extremely sad\"). Additionally, the sentences are clear but could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance the narrative.\n\nScore: 2/3\n\nConventions (3 points):\n\nThe student demonstrates consistent and appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are a few isolated errors, such as missing Articles (e.g., \"the video game station\") and inconsistent use of commas.\n\nScore: 3/3\n\nTotal Score: 10/15\n\nBased on the rubric, I would award the student a score of 8/15. The student's response demonstrates some strengths in Ideas and Organization, but could improve in Style and Conventions. Overall, the response is not thoroughly developed and could benefit from more nuanced language and error-free writing.",

        "essay": "I\u0092m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I\u0092m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you assess and grade the student's answer! Here's my step-by-step review of the response, using the provided rubric to guide my evaluation:\n\nIdeas:\n\nThe student's answer tells a story about a time when they were patient with their younger sister while she was learning to do her makeup. The story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, but it could benefit from more specific and relevant details to fully develop the idea. For example, the student could have described the sister's struggles with applying makeup or their own attempts to help her.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's answer is logically sequenced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the connection between the ideas and events could be more clear and concise. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from their sister's makeup practice to their own experience shopping for makeup, without fully connecting the two events.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's use of language is adequate, with a mix of clear and compound sentences. However, the word choice could be more varied and effective in supporting the writer's purpose and audience. For example, the student uses the same phrase (\"I asked my mom\") multiple times, which could be replaced with more precise and descriptive language.\n\nConventions:\n\nThe student's use of conventions of Standard English is generally consistent and appropriate, with a few minor errors in spelling and punctuation.\n\nBased on the rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\nIdeas: 3/6 (somewhat focused on the topic, but could benefit from more specific details)\nOrganization: 3/3 (logically sequenced, but could be more clear and concise)\nStyle: 2/3 (adequate use of language, but could benefit from more varied word choice)\nConventions: 3/3 (consistent use of conventions, with a few minor errors)\n\nTotal score: 11/15\n\nTherefore, I would award a score of 11/15 to this response. The student has demonstrated some understanding of the topic of patience, but could benefit from more specific details and a more concise organization to fully develop their ideas. Additionally, the student could improve their use of language and conventions to more effectively support their purpose and audience.",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
