With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Content (6 points):\n\nThe student's answer addresses the topic of the benefits and drawbacks of computers in society, but the content is limited and lacks depth. There are only a few reasons given for why computers are beneficial, and the supporting details are sparse. The student does mention some specific examples, such as finding information on the internet and communicating with others online, but these points are not well developed.\n\nRationale: Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 2/6 for content. The student's answer is lacking in detail and clarity, and there is not enough substance to support a higher score.\n\n2. Organization and Structure (2 points):\n\nThe student's answer is structured in a simple list format, with each point numbered. However, the transitions between points are awkward and the response is generally disjointed. There is no clear introduction or conclusion, and the writing is often fragmented and unclear.\n\nRationale: Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 1/2 for organization and structure. The student's answer lacks coherence and does not effectively use transitions or connect ideas.\n\n3.

There are several grammatical errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and incomplete sentences. The language is generally awkward and hard to follow.\n\nRationale: Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 1/2 for language and style. The student's writing is basic and does not effectively use language to convey ideas or engage the reader.\n\n4.

The tone is informal and does not address the reader directly.\n\nRationale: Based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 0/1 for audience awareness.

While the response addresses the topic and provides some general reasons for the benefits of computers, it lacks depth, coherence, and effective language. The student could improve by providing more specific examples, organizing the response more effectively, and using more varied language and transitions.",

First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you assess and grade the student's response. Here's a step-by-step review and rationale for the grade I would assign, based on the provided rubric.\n\nFirst, let me say that the student has made a good effort to express their opinion on the effects of computers on people. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved, and I would score it as follows:\n\nSCORE: 3/6\n\nHere's my reasoning based on the rubric:\n\nScore Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\nThe student's response is not undeveloped, but it does lack specific details and a clear position. While the student mentions some positive and negative effects of computers, they do not take a clear stance or provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.\n\nScore Point 2: An under-developed response that may or may not take a position.\n\nThe student's response is more developed than an under-developed response, but it still lacks specific details and a clear position. While the student provides some general reasons for the positive and negative effects of computers, they do not offer any concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.\n\nScore Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe student's response is minimally developed, but it does take a position and provides some support. However, the support is inadequate and lacks specific details. The student mentions some benefits of computers, such as hand-eye coordination and the ability to learn about faraway places, but they do not provide any evidence or examples to back up their claims.\n\nScore Point 4: A somewhat-developed response that takes a position and provides adequate support.\n\nThe student's response is somewhat developed, but it could be more detailed and supported. The student provides some reasons for the positive effects of computers, such as the ability to communicate with friends and family, but they do not offer any specific examples or evidence to support their claims.\n\nScore Point 5: A developed response that takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is not developed, as it lacks a clear position and persuasive support. While the student mentions some positive and negative effects of computers, they do not take a clear stance or provide sufficient evidence to support their claims.\n\nScore Point 6: A well-developed response that takes a clear and thoughtful position and provides persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is not well-developed, as it lacks a clear position and persuasive support. While the student mentions some general reasons for the positive and negative effects of computers, they do not offer any concrete examples or evidence to support their claims.\n\nOverall, the student's response is minimally developed and lacks a clear position and persuasive support.

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe.

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",
        "marker": " Sure! I'd be happy to help you assess and grade the student's response.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the student's response:\n\nThe student argues that computers are harmful to society, stating that they lead to emotional discomfort, obesity, and a decline in physical activity. They claim that social networks like Facebook and Twitter are dangerous and can lead to bullying, and they share a personal anecdote about a victim of cyberbullying. The student also cites statistics to support their claims, mentioning that obese children spend more time in front of computers than exercising.\n\nNow, let me evaluate the response using the provided rubric:\n\nScore Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\n* The student takes a position that computers are harmful to society, but their support is limited.\n* The response contains few specific details and is largely based on general statements.\n* The student does not provide any evidence or statistics to support their claims.\n* The response is somewhat awkward and fragmented, with limited cohesion and no clear organization.\n\nScore: 1/6\n\nScore Point 2: An under-developed response that may or may not take a position.\n\n* The student takes a position, but their arguments are underdeveloped and lack specific details.\n* The response contains general reasons with unelaborated and list-like details.\n* The student shows little awareness of audience and does not consider counterarguments.\n* The response is somewhat awkward and confused, with limited organization and no clear transitions.\n\nScore: 2/6\n\nScore Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\n* The student takes a position, but their support is inadequate and lacks specific details.\n* The response contains some reasons, but they are not well-elaborated and are mostly general.\n* The student shows some awareness of audience, but does not consider counterarguments.\n* The response is somewhat awkward, with limited organization and some fragments.\n\nScore: 3/6\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 3/6 to the student's response. While the student takes a position and provides some reasons to support their claims, their arguments are underdeveloped and lack specific details. Additionally, the response is somewhat awkward and fragmented, with limited cohesion and no clear organization.\n\nOverall, the student's response could benefit from more detailed and specific supporting evidence, as well as improved organization and cohesion. By addressing these areas, the student could strengthen their argument and better persuade their audience.",

Instead, the response is focused on the student's personal opinions and biases, which are not supported by evidence from the text.\n\nFirstly, the student's statement that the cyclist's experience does not change and does not affect anyone is not supported by the text. The essay depicts the cyclist's journey through a desert landscape, facing challenges such as high temperatures, ferocious winds, and a lack of water. This shows that the setting has a significant impact on the cyclist's experience.\n\nFurthermore, the student's reference to @CAPS1 and the assumption that the author of the essay is writing about people who do not care about the cyclist is not supported by the text. The essay does not mention anyone who does not care about the cyclist, and it is not about making generalizations about people.\n\nAdditionally, the student's statement that the setting does not affect black people is not accurate. The essay does not mention race or ethnicity, and it is not about making assumptions about people based on their background.\n\nThe student's response also lacks any explanation or elaboration on how the setting affects the cyclist. The essay provides detailed descriptions of the setting, including the desert landscape, the wind, and the heat, which all have a significant impact on the cyclist's experience. However, the student does not engage with these details or provide any analysis of how they contribute to the overall experience of the cyclist.\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response does not meet the expectations of a strong analysis of the setting's effects on the cyclist. The response is focused on personal opinions and biases, rather than engaging with the text and providing evidence-based analysis. Therefore, the score awarded is 1/3.",

The response uses some expressed or implied information from the text to demonstrate understanding, but does not fully connect the support to a conclusion or assertion made about the text.\n\nTo begin, the student accurately identifies that the cyclist had a rough time and that the elements were against him. They mention that the cyclist had no water and that the heat and dryness made it difficult for him. This is a good start, as it shows that the student has understood the text at a basic level.\n\nHowever, the response becomes more fragmented and lacks a clear organization or conclusion. The student mentions the presence of weeds and a snake in the path, but does not fully explain how these elements contributed to the cyclist's difficulties. Additionally, the student notes that the man was alone and had no buildings or structures in sight, but does not fully explore the emotional or psychological effects of this isolation on the cyclist.\n\nFurthermore, while the student mentions the hills as a challenge for the cyclist, they do not fully explain how the setting affected the cyclist. The text states that the hills were \"long, crippling,\" and that the cyclist had to \"climb away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.\" The student could have expanded on how the challenging terrain and the lack of water affected the cyclist's physical and mental state.\n\nLastly, the student's response lacks depth and nuance. They do not explore the themes of the essay, such as the reliability of old men's advice or the perils of dehydration, and do not offer any insights or interpretations beyond the literal level.\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the complexities of the text. They accurately identify some of the challenges faced by the cyclist, but lack a clear organization and depth of analysis. To improve, the student could focus on developing a stronger thesis statement, organizing their ideas more clearly, and delving deeper into the themes and emotions of the text. SCORE: 2/3.",

The question asks for a description of the mood created by the author in the memoir, and the student attempts to do so. However, there are several issues with the response.\n\n1. Missing relevant information: The student fails to mention any specific examples from the memoir that support their description of the mood created by the author. For example, the student does not mention the author's description of the simple house, the warmth of the kitchen, or the celebrations that filled the air with scent, music, and life. These specific examples are crucial in creating a vivid picture of the mood created by the author.\n2. Lack of accuracy: The student uses incorrect vocabulary and grammar throughout the response. For instance, \"Immagrants\" should be \"immigrants,\" and \"CAPS1\" and \"CAPS2\" are not recognized abbreviations. Additionally, the student misspells \"Cuban\" as \"Cuban\" multiple times.\n3. Limited analysis: The student does not provide any in-depth analysis of the mood created by the author. Instead, they focus on general aspects of the memoir, such as the difficulty of the immigration experience and the importance of family.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the student's response based on the provided rubric.\n\n1. Point 4: The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author. The response includes relevant and specific information from the memoir.\n\nThe student's response is incomplete and inaccurate, failing to provide specific examples from the memoir that support their description of the mood created by the author.

However, the response is often general and lacks specific examples from the memoir. Therefore, the student's response partially meets the criteria for Point 3.\n\n3. Point 2: The response is a partial description of the mood created by the author. The response includes limited information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nThe student's response is partial and includes limited information from the memoir.

Let's dive into the student's response and assess its strengths and weaknesses based on the provided rubric.\n\nFirstly, the student's response is written in a clear and concise manner, which is a positive aspect. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved.\n\nTo address the first point of the rubric, \"The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author,\" we need to examine how well the student describes the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir.\n\nThe student successfully identifies the mood created by the author as \"love, peace, & appreciation.\" However, the response could be more specific and detailed in its explanation. For instance, the student could have highlighted specific phrases or passages from the memoir that reinforce this mood, such as \"the warmth of the kitchen\" or \"the many things I learned there about how to love.\" This level of detail would have earned a higher score under this criterion.\n\nMoving on to the second point of the rubric, \"The response includes relevant and specific information from the memoir,\" we see that the student has provided some relevant information from the memoir, but could have more robustly supported their analysis with specific examples. For example, the student mentions that the author expresses gratitude for their parents, but they could have provided a more specific quote to illustrate this point. Including more specific examples from the text would have strengthened the response.\n\nNow, let's turn to the third point of the rubric, \"The response is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author.\" Here, we can see that the student's response is mostly clear and complete, but there are some minor inaccuracies that detract from the overall effectiveness of the description. For instance, the student states that the author \"again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home.\" However, this is not entirely accurate, as the author only mentions their parents once in the passage. While this is a minor error, it does detract from the response's overall score.\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the response based on the fourth point of the rubric, \"The response includes relevant but often general information from the memoir.\" Unfortunately, the student's response is often general and does not provide specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support their analysis. This lack of specificity detracts from the response's overall effectiveness.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 2 out of 4. The student's response is partially accurate and includes some relevant information from the memoir, but it lacks specific examples and details to fully support their analysis.

The response includes relevant and specific information from the memoir.\n\nThe student accurately identifies the mood created by the author as one of gratitude. They provide several examples from the memoir that support this interpretation, such as the author's statement that her parents \"came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life\" and her repeated expressions of thanks to her parents.\n\nScore Point 3: The response is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author. The response includes relevant but often general information from the memoir.\n\nHowever, the student's response could be more specific and detailed in some areas. For example, they could have expanded on the specific examples provided in the memoir to further support their interpretation of the mood. Additionally, the response could benefit from more nuanced language and a more sophisticated analysis of the author's use of language and tone to create the desired mood.\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the mood created by the author. The response includes limited information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nWhile the student provides some specific examples from the memoir, their response is somewhat limited in scope. They focus primarily on the author's expressions of gratitude, but do not fully explore the other aspects of the mood created by the author, such as the sense of community and the emphasis on family. Additionally, the student's interpretation of the mood may be slightly off, as they seem to rely solely on the theme of gratitude to support their analysis.\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the mood created by the author. The response includes little or no information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nOR \nThe response relates minimally to the task.\n\nThe student's response does not fully address the task of describing the mood created by the author in the memoir.

Here's a step-by-step review of their response:\n\nStep 1: The student mentions that Al Smith was a very competitive person and that he had to make his building taller than the Chrysler building to avoid losing the title of the tallest building in New York. This is partially accurate, as the excerpt does mention that Al Smith was determined to outstrip the Chrysler Building in height. However, the student does not mention any of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.\n\nStep 2: The student's response continues with a statement that dirigibles were not safe due to their use of hydrogen, and that the Hindenburg disaster in 1937 highlighted the danger. This is partially accurate, as the excerpt does mention that most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and that the Hindenburg disaster did occur. However, the student does not provide any specific information from the excerpt to support their statement.\n\nStep 3: The student's response mentions that the mooring mast was never used for its intended purpose because dirigibles were not allowed to fly low over urban areas, and that the law against airships flying low was passed after the Hindenburg disaster.

The higher calling for which the mooring mast was built was to put New York on the forefront of modern travel; the builders then needed to solve some obstacles that were on their way. First, the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support \"a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building.\" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, $60,000 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure. The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the response and the rationale for the grade:\n\nStep 1: comprehension of the task\nResponse: The student accurately comprehends the task and describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.\nRationale: full credit - The student clearly understands the task and provides a response that accurately describes the obstacles the builders faced.\n\nStep 2: completeness\nResponse: The response is a mostly complete description of the obstacles the builders faced.\nRationale: The response is filled with relevant information from the excerpt but does not address all the details mentioned. The student mentions three of the four obstacles described in the excerpt (modifying the building's framework, addressing wind pressure, and providing a space for passengers) but does not mention the final obstacle (the risk of airship accidents).\n\nStep 3: clarity\nResponse: The response is a clear, mostly accurate, and complete description of the obstacles the builders faced.\nRationale: The response is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear transitions between ideas. However, there is one inaccuracy (\"the building needed to get stronger\" instead of \"the building needed to be modified and strengthened\").\n\nStep 4: relevance\nResponse: The response is relevant to the task and includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt.\nRationale: The student provides relevant information from the excerpt and includes specific details such as the amount of money needed to be spent on modifications ($60,000) and the location of the observation deck (the 86th floor).\n\nTotal score: 3/4\n\nOverall, the student's response accurately describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, the response is incomplete, as it does not address all the details mentioned in the excerpt. Additionally, there is one inaccuracy in the language used. Therefore, the student's response receives a grade of 3 out of 4 possible points.",

Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger.

The response begins by stating the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. This is a good start, as it directly addresses the question and provides a clear overview of the main challenges.\n2. The response mentions the risk of hydrogen-filled dirigibles catching fire, which is accurate information from the excerpt. However, the student could have elaborated more on this point, as it is a significant safety concern.\n3. The next point made by the student is about the violent winds and shifting currents, which is also accurate. However, the student could have provided more specific examples from the excerpt to support this point.\n4. The student then mentions the law about airships flying too low over urban areas, which is a good point. However, they could have explained how this law would make it illegal for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building.\n5. The final point made by the student is about the use of lead weights to hold the dirigibles in place. While this is a valid concern, the student could have discussed how this would not be a practical solution due to the risk of the weights falling and causing damage or injury.\n\nOverall, the student has provided a reasonably accurate and well-organized response, but there are some areas that could be improved.

They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

        "essay": "Patient are people who been injured in same kind of way and are in the hospital trying or are getting better. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot. On our way out of the hospital I blacked out and hit my chin on the door so we had to stay their for about an hour. That was the only time that I was in the hospital being a patient.",
        "marker": " Certainly! Let's dive into the student's response and assess it using the provided rubric.\n\nFirst, let's examine the ideas presented in the story. The student has told a story about a time when they were sick and had to go to the hospital. The story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, as it describes the student's experience of being in the hospital and the difficulties they faced. However, the ideas are not thoroughly developed, as the story is quite brief and lacks specific details.\n\nNext, let's look at the organization of the story. The student has presented a logical sequence of events, but the connections between ideas and events are not always clear. The story jumps abruptly from the student being in the hospital to blacking out and hitting their chin on the door. This lack of clarity and cohesion detracts from the overall effectiveness of the story.\n\nMoving on to style, the student's use of language is adequate but could be more effective. The word choice is generally good, but the sentences are quite simple and lack variety. This limited use of language may hinder the support for the student's purpose and audience.\n\nFinally, let's examine the conventions of the student's writing. There are some errors in grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, which suggests limited use of conventions of Standard English for the grade level.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, here is my assessment:\n\nIdeas: SCORE: 2/6 (somewhat focused on the topic, but not thoroughly developed with specific details)\n\nOrganization: SCORE: 2/3 (logical sequence of events, but connections between ideas and events are not always clear)\n\nStyle: SCORE: 2/3 (adequate use of language, but limited variety in sentences)\n\nConventions: SCORE: 1/3 (limited use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation)\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 6/15\n\nTherefore, I would award the student a score of 6/15 for this question. While the student has made some efforts to tell a story about patience, the story lacks focus and clarity, and there are grammatical errors in the writing. To improve, the student should focus on developing their ideas more thoroughly and using more precise and varied language to support their purpose and audience.",

The student has told a story about a time when they were patient, which is relevant to the prompt. However, the ideas are not as clearly focused on the topic as they could be. The story jumps around a bit and could benefit from more specific details.\n\nFor Organization, the student has logically sequenced the events of the story, but the connections between the ideas and events could be stronger. The student could have used transition words or phrases to connect the ideas more smoothly.\n\nMoving on to Style, the student's command of language is adequate, but there is room for improvement.

The story is developed with a mix of specific and general details. For example, the student mentions specific details such as the number of brothers and sisters and the name of the video game, but also uses general terms like \"all\" and \"never\" that do not fully develop the ideas. Score: 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's organization and connections between ideas and/or events are logically sequenced, but could be more clear. The student jumps abruptly from discussing the difficulty of waiting for a turn to play a video game to the reward of finally getting to play. Additionally, the student does not explicitly state the lesson they learned about patience. Score: 2.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's command of language is adequate, but could be more effective in supporting their purpose and audience. The student uses some varied sentence structures, but also uses some general terms that do not fully develop their ideas. Score: 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions of Standard English is adequate, with some inconsistencies in grammar, usage, and spelling. For example, the student uses \"preaty\" instead of \"pretty\" and \"\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\" instead of \"wait.\" Score: 2.\n\nOverall, the student's response is impacted by some inconsistencies in organization and conventions, but the student does tell a story that is somewhat focused on the topic of patience and uses some varied sentence structures.
