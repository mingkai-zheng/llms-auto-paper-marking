The response is also awkwardly written with poor structure and grammar, which makes it difficult to read and understand. Sentence fragments and misused words (\"to much\") further contribute to the confusion. Lastly, the response does not demonstrate any awareness of the audience, as it simply lists its points without any transitional language.\n\nThe response does not contain elaborated reasons, specific details, organization, transitional language, or audience awareness and is therefore very undeveloped. It is unlikely to persuade a reader of its position due to its lack of support and clarity.\n\nThe response would benefit from more elaboration on why computers are good, such as providing specific examples or personal experiences of how they have helped people. Structuring the response into proper sentences and paragraphs would also improve readability and clarity. Lastly, using more persuasive language would help appeal to the audience and make the argument more convincing. \n\nHowever, based on the existing rubric, this answer corresponds to a Score Point 1. \nThe student's response clearly takes a position and provides minimal support. The sense of the organization can be perceived, but it lacks coherence. There's little awareness of the audience, and it's awkwardly written.\n\nSCORE: 1/6.",

The letter is also hard to read due to lack of proper sentence structure and grammar.\n\nThe points put forward to support the argument are not well-structured. They appear to be listed without sufficient elaboration and more general than specific examples. The position the student takes is clear, computers have a positive effect on people, but the details he/she provides in support of that position are undeveloped and vague. The student lists a variety of things that people can do with computers (e.g., make holiday and birthday cards, book hotels, play games, chat online), but he/she does not expand on these points or explain how they benefit people or society. \n\nLooking at the organization, the ideas are presented in a list-like manner rather than in a logical or meaningful order. As a result, the argument lacks flow and cohesion, and readers may struggle to understand or follow the student\u2019s argument.\n\nThe response offers little awareness of the audience, with the usage of \"@CAPS\" placeholders without replacement resulting in a confusing read, making it difficult for the readers to follow along.\n\nFrom the errors seen, we can see the letter did not make enough effort to ensure clarity of thought.

Despite all these points, the student also acknowledges the potential downside of spending too much time on computers and wisely suggests that people should avoid taking advantage of it. \n\nHowever, the response lacks strong organization. The introduction goes straight into the points without setting up the context of the letter. Moreover, the ideas jump from point to point without any apparent transitions or connections between them.

Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online.

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world.

Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

The writer identified that computers aid in communication with loved ones; however, there was no further elaboration on this point. Instead, the statement was followed by awkward phrasing that makes it unclear and difficult for the reader to understand. For example, \"Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing.\" This sentence is stylistically awkward and makes a weak argument due to its lack of detail and specificity.\n\nThe student also mentioned online shopping. Howler, similarly to their earlier point, there is a lack of detail and development in this argument. For instance, the statements, \"Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at\" and \"is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shopping so that we can,\" are quite confused and do not effectively illustrate the advantages of online shopping.\n\nThe student does make an attempt at organizing their arguments; however, the support for these lacks sufficient development and the presence of many incomplete sentences makes the letter hard to follow. The student appears somewhat aware of their audience as they are trying to make arguments that would persuade a general reader, although the lack of sophistication and clarity in these arguments undermines this.\n\nBased on the rubric, this student's response falls into the category of \"Score Point 1\" as it is an undeveloped response offering very minimal support with an awkward and fragmented structure.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "marker": "The student's response clearly takes the position that computers are beneficial and provides some reasoning to back up this point. The student states that computers teach hand-eye coordination, offer information about diverse places, and allow for online interaction with family and friends. The letter is properly addressed to the newspaper and is sufficiently structured with an introduction, body, and conclusion.\n\nHowever, the points to support the provided argument are essentially echoed from the information given in the prompt question and are not further elaborated, making their points seem generalized. Moreover, they could have provided more personal experiences or extra real-life examples to reinforce their argument. \n\nIn terms of organization, the essay clearly identifies separate points in different sections, providing a reasonable flow to the argument. Though it lacks sophisticated transitional language, the essay is easy to follow with a structured introduction, body, and conclusion.\n\nWhile the letter flirts with strong persuasive language \u2013 \"Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them\" \u2013, it mainly retells the prompt instead of truly building up an argument. The mistakes in spelling (like \"posotive\" instead of \"positive\", \"feal\" instead of \"feel\", \"meat\" instead of \"meet\"), lack of proper punctuation and capitalization, and informal language (like \"with with\") detracts from the professionalism and comprehension of the piece.\n\nConsidering all of these points, the student's answer falls into the category of a somewhat-developed response, netting a SCORE: 4/6.

Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

The student mentions several beneficial aspects of computers such as enhancing hand-eye coordination, enabling people to connect with friends and learn about distant places, and being a great source for research and information. The student also acknowledges the negative impacts, but argues that these can be mitigated by limiting usage and balancing time spent on computers with physical activities and social interactions.\n\nThe letter is reasonably well organized, exhibits fluency and some transition language, like 'for example', 'but', and 'also'.

        "essay": "I disagree what people say about computers. Likewise of corse they teach hand eye coordination. But they are not good enough for people. Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",
        "marker": "The student's response to the question does take a clear position stating that computers do not have a positive effect on people. However, the support given to this position is poor and lacks any form of well-articulated detail which makes it an under-developed response. \n\nThe response starts off abruptly without any form of introduction talking about disagreement with people's views. There are numerous errors in styling and grammar throughout the text making it read awkwardly. The use of colloquial terms and phrasing such as \"People are so fat! Wounder why.\" and \"@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese\" rather detracts from the credibility of the argument. \n\nThe structure of the response is mostly confusing. For instance, the student makes a random mention of incomes of baseball players, without providing any context, or explanation on how it relates to the central argument about computer's negative effects. This makes the response difficult to read and understand. \n\nThe argument against online interactions leans towards being sensationalistic instead of informative or persuasive. Phrases like \"There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder\" and \"... Or might get yourself killed\" may incite fear, but does little in way of actually persuading the reader in an intellectual manner.\n\nThe response lacks any form of transitions which makes the arguments feel disjointed and unorganized. Furthermore, the student shows little to no awareness of the audience. The response commonly uses informal language and has a number of un-cleared mentions like @PERCENT1, @LOCATION1, @NUM1 to @MONEY1 that take away from the comprehensibility and coherence of the argument.\n\nIn conclusion, while the student takes a position, the response does not provide any effective or persuasive reasoning or details to support this position. The errors in grammar, usage, and conventions, the confusing organization of the response, and the lack of awareness of the audience, all work against the effectiveness of the student's argument.\n\nSCORE: 1/6",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "The student's response clearly takes a position against the use of computers, arguing that the negative effects outweigh the benefits. They offer several reasons why they believe computers have a negative impact, including obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying.\n\nWhile attempting to elaborate, the explanations are mostly general and lack specific details. For example, the student mentions obesity caused by excessive computer use but does not provide data or statistics to back up the claim. The same applies to the arguments surrounding cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying.\n\nThe organization of the essay could have been improved. While the student tries to segregate the reasons into different paragraphs, the flow between them is a bit disjointed. For example, the argument about sexual harassment jumps abruptly to cyberbullying without a proper transition or conclusion.\n\nThe essay contains several typographical and grammar errors, making it somewhat challenging to read and comprehend in some parts. \n\nThe student does show some degree of awareness about the audience as the letter is directed to the readers of a local newspaper and invites them at the end to state their opinion on the issue. \n\nBased on these aspects, I would categorize the essay as a somewhat-developed response, exhibiting some satisfying attributes of organization and language, but with insufficient support for the presented arguments. Therefore, a score of 4 best reflects the quality of this essay. \n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer.

        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position in favor of computers, arguing that technology is an important part of life and can teach kids crucial skills, such as hand-eye coordination and how to use technology. The student uses a mix of general arguments and more specific details to back up this point of view. For instance, they generalise by saying that technology will continue to increase in future years. Meanwhile, they provide specific examples, such as the quote from a named expert and the mention of their sister who has benefitted from growing up around computers.\n\nThe response shows some degree of organization - there is an introduction where the writer's opinion is stated, followed by detailed support for this opinion, and finally, a conclusion where they restates and reinforces their key points. However, the elements are not always clearly or logically connected. The response lacks transitional language that would guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next, and some parts are awkwardly phrased such as \"conversly you can set limits & child block.\" or \"Kid therapist @PERSON2 says \"kid who chat, with other kids though internet like facebook, @CAPS3, & myspace are normaly more socialy interactive with other kids.\". There is also frequent use of informal and incorrect language, which gives the essay an unpolished feel, and could distract the reader or even risk confusing them.\n\nThe student also shows some awareness of the audience. They address the readers directly, even offering practical advice (\"you can set limits & child block\", \"give them time limits\"). However, their use of language and tone is not always suitable for the intended audience of a local newspaper.\n\nFor these reasons, this essay merits a score of 3/6. It is a minimally-developed response that steers clear of being merely under-developed or undeveloped, but it doesn't quite meet the standards of a somewhat-developed or developed response due to its awkward phrasing, lack of transition, and occasionally unsuitable tone and language. \n\nScore: 3/6.",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position on the issue, arguing that spending time on computers has a negative effect on people by leading them to spend less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with their friends and family. The points are adequately elaborated, using hypothetical questions and scenarios to help the reader envision the negative effects. The sentences are mostly fluent and the language used is largely appropriate.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved in a number of areas. The organization could be better: each major point - the lack of time for exercise, the lack of time for nature, and the lack of time for friends and family - could be grouped into separate paragraphs, which would make it easier for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. Beyond brief mentions of playing games and chatting online, the response also falls short on specific examples or data that might have made the argument more convincing. The response could also improve in the awareness of audience. The use of informal language such as \"ect.\" and \"probaly\" is inappropriate for the intended audience (readers of a newspaper).\n\nBased on the points above, I would assign a score of 3 out of 6 for this response. This response takes a position and contains reasons with minimal elaboration, shows a level of organization despite the absence of clear paragraph breaks, and uses language that is fluent but too informal for the intended audience.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise.

While the language utilized is informally fitting for a letter to the editor format, it fails to address the readers directly or convincingly argue its point for them to agree.\n\nFurthermore, the piece contains several spelling and grammatical errors which degrade its legibility, such as \"@CAPS13 anything about,\" \"@CAPS7 @CAPS8 mail carriers taking a @CAPS10-mail from one person to another,\" and \"They can help get video racism they can help make the world more ideal.\" The misuse of these caps locks disrupts the natural flow and could potentially confuse the reader.\n\nOn account of these reasons, I would allocate this essay a 2 out of 6. The student takes a position although unsuccessfully persuades readers due to lack of elaboration, ineffective organization, numerous syntax errors, and a lack of audience awareness.\n\nSCORE: 2/6.",

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": "The student\u2019s response provides a relatively developed argument on how computers positively impact students, working adults, and people wishing to stay in contact with family members around the world. The essay touches upon the value of computers in education, work, long-distance communication, and at times hints towards the importance of computers in time management and housing stability. \n\nHowever, the essay has several signs of low-quality execution. The student's response contains several typos and grammatical errors which impede clarity. They impair the reader's comprehension and lower the fluency of the argument. Transitions between ideas are weak and inconsistent, leading to poor organization and flow of ideas. The argument fails to engage the audience adequately because the ideas are not presented in a competent and compelling manner. Moreover, the student misinterpreted the task by providing a summary of the potential benefits of computers instead of a persuasive argument about how computers impact society.\n\nApplying the rubric, this essay is awarded a Score Point 3. It does take a clear position and provides reasons supporting the idea, but it doesn't offer sufficient elaboration and more general than specific details. The organization of the argument is unclear due to awkward transitions and lack of coherence between ideas. Even though there are several typos and grammatical errors, the essay still portrays a certain degree of awareness of intended audience.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",
        "marker": "The student takes a clear position on the topic that computers are detrimental to society. The letter offers a well-formulated argument and provides specific details and reasons to support the position, such as cyber bullying, addiction to computers, and the physical health implications resulting from excessive computer usage. The examples given are emotional and relatable, which shows that the student is aware of the audience and attempts to persuade them.\n\nThe student displays a satisfactory standard of organization throughout the letter with an introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction immediately states the student's opinions on the issue, while the body provides the specific arguments to support these opinions. The conclusion nicely sums up the main points of the letter and reiterates the necessity of taking action against the problems highlighted. \n\nThere is a considerable amount of transitional language that connect thoughts and ideas, enhancing the fluency of the letter. For example, phrases like \"Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical\" and \"As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand...\" nicely transition from one point to the next, indicating a commendable level of writing competency. \n\nHowever, there are some areas where the student could have improved the response. There are several missing or incorrect words, which make some sentences hard to read, such as \"This crazy computing must end!\" and \"computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2\". In addition, the student used \"@\" placeholders instead of filling them with appropriate words, which detracts from the credibility and engagement of the arguments. Also, the reference to a quote by '@PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1', doesn't seem credible due to the unexplained placeholders. \n\nLastly, while the writing is generally well-structured, the pace of the letter is somewhat rushed. A better separation and more detailed exploration of each issue (cyber bullying, addiction, physical health) would have allowed for a more comprehensive and convincing argument. \n\nGiven these considerations, the response aligns best with Score Point 4. It is an adequately developed response, takes a clear position, provides substantial support, and demonstrates a reasonable level of awareness of the audience. However, missing or incorrect words and the use of \"@\" placeholders somewhat detract from the fluency and persuasiveness of the response.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

These details include the empty towns, the heat, the deceptive advice given by the old men, and the physically demanding terrain described as short, rolling hills. The student does a commendable job of explaining each of the difficulties and how they affect the cyclist, such as the dehydration from the desert and the toll that the hills take on his strength.\n\nHowever, there are few inaccuracies and some missing information. The student incorrectly states that the cyclist didn't trust the old man who advised him to continue 18 miles to the next town. According to the essay, the cyclist did, in fact, follow their advice, which led to his difficulties. The student also neglects to mention the mental and emotional toll the difficult journey takes on the cyclist, as described in the essay.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, the issues with accuracy and omission mean the response does not fully address all aspects of the question. Although the response does develop most parts of the question, the lack of clarity and the slight misinterpretations hinder the development.

For example, while on her way home after failing her driver\u0092s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, \u0093[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.\u0094 This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, \u0093She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become\u0085almost familiar to her now.\u0094 Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here.

Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even \"swivel around the mooring mast.\" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, \"This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...\" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose.",

The response, however, lacks in-depth development and organization of ideas, making the story confusing at times.

Some details are specific but scattered, such as the father\u2019s deployment and the sibling waiting for mail, which don\u2019t form a comprehensive story. Therefore, the score would be 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe ideas and events in the text lack logical sequencing and this makes it somewhat difficult to follow the story. The mentions of family members\u2019 patience are somewhat connected, but it feels more like a list of items rather than a well-connected story. The score for this category would be 1.\n\nStyle:\nThe use of language is limited with a lack of sentence variety, and it doesn\u2019t effectively support the writer's purpose. The structure of the sentences is quite basic, which can hinder the support for the writer's purpose and even mask the message of the story. Therefore, the score in this category would be 1.\n\nConventions:\nThe writer shows limited use of conventions, with various grammatical errors and language inconsistencies throughout the response. For example, \"my family is patent\" instead of \"my family is patient\", \"baits dects\" which is unclear, \u201cthe school year to end\u201d without specifying why, and many other errors are present.

However, there is a lack of well-developed, specific details that fully expands on their experience or feelings about patience; the details given are quite general.

Therefore, the Ideas score is a 2. \n\nThe narrative does connect the sequence of the experience logically and clearly.

The sense of time passing and patience are inferred primarily from the context, rather than explicit narration. Therefore, the Organization is scored a 2.\n\nThere is limited creativity in the use of language and lack of variety in both sentence structure and word choice.

The student mostly stays focused on the topic of patience and illustrates it with a made-up story, thus meeting the task requirement. However, there are several details which seem unnecessary and distract from the main focus like mentioning about the cousin multiple times.\n\nOrganization: The student is awarded a score of 2. The organization is logically sequenced and we can infer the actions as well as follow the flow of the protagonist's actions. But it does lack suitable transitions and connections leading to slight confusion in places.\n\nStyle: The writing style garners a score of 1. There's a noticeable lack of varied sentence structure and compelling vocabulary, which hinders support for the writer's situation. There are also spelling errors and grammar errors which make the narrative difficult to understand in places.\n\nConventions: The student makes frequent spelling errors (like wrighting, convenance, grocres), improper use of punctuation, and grammatical errors that affect understandability thereby earning a score of 1.\n\n In conclusion, the student's response is acceptable, but there's significant room for improvement in terms of spelling, grammar, and sentence structure.

For instance, the character @CAPS8 kicking @PERSON1 to a tree does not seem to relate to demonstrating patience.

They could, however, further explain their feelings and thoughts during the wait to deepen the portrayal of patience. Therefore, I would score this a 4 for 'ideas'.\n\nThe story's organization is logical beginning from waiting for the grandparents, realizing the extended plans, accommodating changes, and finally making their way to the desired destination. The events are sequenced sensibly with clear connections between the ideas, thus earning a score of 3 for 'organization'.\n\nThe student commands the language adequately with clear sentences and effective word choices that suit the audience, such as \"we were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures\", \"we had found out\", \"we new that it was going to take a long time\", \"we can wait\", \"she drove all of us back to our houses\", etc. However, the variety in sentence structure is limited and the narrative could be enhanced with some compelling word choices. Hence, the 'style' earns a score of 2.\n\nThe conventions of Standard English have been used inconsistently. Multiple grammatical errors, such as \"we new that\", \"my grandparent were caring\", etc., along with multiple misspellings like \"suppose\" instead of \"supposed\", \"carring\" instead of \"carrying\", limit the understanding and fluency of the narrative. Missing punctuation and improper capitalization also hinder the quality of the writing, thus, the 'conventions' category scores a 1.\n\nSCORE: 10/15.",

        "marker": "Ideas:\nThis personal reflective essay revolves around the concept of patience, how the narrator has to be so with their sibling, and later has a similar experience with makeup. The focal narrative unfolds well and maintains relevance to the topic of patience. However, the development of ideas and concrete details are limited. For instance, the student could have added insights about how they apply patience in dealing with the sibling or during the training in makeup. There is too much telling than showing. Therefore, a score of 4 is suitable. \n\nOrganization: \nThe essay is organized well, revealing a systematic and logical progression of events and ideas. From the initial discussion on the sibling to the making up story and the concluding thoughts, the reader has no difficulty in following the narrative. However, connections between ideas and events could have been stronger. Therefore, the organization of this essay can be scored a 2.\n\nStyle:\nThe user of language in this essay is mostly clear but lacks variety and inventiveness. The sentences are mostly simple and clear but lack complexity and variance in structure. While the language is generally effective, it lacks the compelling quality that could have made the writing more engaging. Therefore, a score of 2 fits the student's language choice and sentence structure.\n\nConventions:\nThe student has a fair command over the use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
