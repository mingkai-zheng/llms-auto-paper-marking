Some people spend too much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.\"\n\nFirst, let's look at the organization of the response. The student has listed three reasons for why computers are good, but there is no clear introduction or conclusion. The response is also quite short, which suggests that it may not be fully developed. Score: 2/6\n\nNext, let's examine the reasons given by the student. The first reason is that computers allow people to communicate with friends and family. This is a valid point, but it is not elaborated upon. The second reason is that computers are necessary for job searches, which is also a valid point. However, the third reason, that some people spend too much time on computers and not enough time on homework, is not well-elaborated and seems tacked on. Score: 2/6\n\nNow, let's look at the details provided by the student. The student has provided some general details about how computers can be used for communication and job searches, but there are no specific examples or elaboration. Score: 2/6\n\nIn terms of audience awareness, the student does not address the reader directly or use persuasive language to convince the reader of their position. Score: 1/6\n\nFinally, let's evaluate the grammar and mechanics of the response. There are several errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling, which make the response difficult to read and understand. Score: 1/6\n\nOverall, the student's response scores 6/6. The response is underdeveloped, lacks organization, and contains several errors in grammar and mechanics. While the student has provided some valid reasons for why computers are good, the response does not persuasively argue for their position, and the reader is left with more questions than answers.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer.

Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.",

Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it.

Instead of simply stating that computers are a good thing, the student could provide a brief overview of the issue and explain why they believe computers are beneficial.\n\nSecond, the response could provide more specific and detailed examples to support the argument. For instance, instead of simply stating that computers help people communicate with family and friends who live far away, the student could provide an example of a specific instance where a computer was used to facilitate communication between two people who would not have been able to communicate otherwise. Similarly, the student could provide more specific examples of how computers have helped people manage their finances or access information about distant places.\n\nThird, the response could benefit from more persuasive language and rhetorical devices to make the argument more compelling. For example, the student could use repetition, parallelism, or other literary devices to emphasize key points and make the argument more engaging.\n\nFourth, the response could benefit from more attention to sentence-level grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are several instances of grammatical errors, missing punctuation, and spelling mistakes throughout the response, which can distract from the overall effectiveness of the argument.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\n* Score Point 1: 1/6\nThe response does take a position, but it offers very minimal support and few details.

They also address potential concerns about screen time and obesity by suggesting time limits and child blocking features.\n\nHowever, there are several areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, the student's writing is not always clear and concise, with some awkward phrasing and sentence structure.

While they mention that their sister's computer skills helped her get a job, they could have provided more details about how this happened and what specific skills she learned.\n\nAnother issue with the response is that the student does not always address the reader directly. While they do use the phrase \"you know\" to acknowledge the reader's perspective, they could have done more to engage the reader and make the argument more persuasive.

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

Additionally, the response jumps between different ideas without a clear organization, making it difficult to follow at times.\n\nThe writer also uses awkward phrasing and sentence structures, which can make the response hard to understand. For instance, \"Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there\" is a confusing sentence that could have been rephrased for clarity.\n\nHowever, the response shows some awareness of the audience, as the writer addresses the reader directly and uses a persuasive tone. The writer also attempts to use transitional language, such as \"Does that realy sound a 'great deal'?\" to connect their ideas.\n\nOverall, the response could benefit from more specific details, improved organization, and clearer writing. The student has demonstrated some understanding of the topic, but the response is underdeveloped and lacks persuasive power.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction.

I apprisiate that so much,\u0094 \u0093@CAPS5 to I\u0092ll see you guys next time ok.\u0094 @CAPS5 we said \u0093bye.\u0094\n\nNow, let's evaluate the response using the provided rubric:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's response does not tell a story with a clear focus on the topic of patience. The student briefly mentions being patient while waiting for their appointment, but the majority of the response focuses on the events that occurred during the appointment, rather than the idea of patience itself. Therefore, I would score this section a 2, as the ideas are somewhat focused on the topic but could be more thoroughly developed.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the response is somewhat logical, but there are some confusing elements. For example, the student mentions the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 offices, but it's not entirely clear what these offices represent or why they are important to the story. Additionally, the transitions between ideas could be smoother. I would score this section a 2, as the organization is logical but could be improved.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but there are some areas that could be improved. For example, there are some grammatical errors (e.g. \"At the @CAPS1\u0092s office\" should be \"At the @CAPS1 office\"), and the sentence structure is fairly simple. The student could benefit from using more varied sentence structures and descriptive language to engage the reader. I would score this section a 2, as the command of language is adequate but could be improved.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but there are some errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For example, there are missing articles (\"@CAPS1\" instead of \"the @CAPS1\"), missing commas after introductory phrases, and incorrect spellings (e.g. \"apprisiate\" instead of \"appreciate\"). I would score this section a 2, as the use of conventions is adequate but could be improved.\n\nOverall, I would give the student's response a score of 6 out of 15. While there are some positive elements to the response, such as the brief mention of patience and the use of adequate language, there are also areas that could be improved, such as the focus on the topic, organizational structure, and conventions. With some revisions and further development, the student's response could be even stronger.\n\nSCORE: 6/15",

Here's my evaluation, referenced to the provided rubric:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide specific details about their experience waiting at the doctor's office. They also include some personal feelings and reactions, such as getting bored and frustrated. However, the story could be more developed and include more relevant details. For example, they could describe the setting, the other people in the waiting room, or how they felt when they finally got called in. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. They start by describing the situation, then describe their feelings and actions, and finally, they describe the resolution. However, the connections between ideas and events could be clearer. For example, they could explain why they got impatient and what they did to cope with their impatience. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's language is generally clear and understandable, but there is room for improvement in terms of vocabulary and sentence structure. They use simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the story a bit flat. They also use some filler words and phrases, such as \"like\" and \"you know.\" However, they do use some descriptive language, such as \"boring\" and \"frustrating.\" Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's response has some conventions errors, such as missing capitals and incorrect punctuation. For example, they write \"doctors\" instead of \"Doctors\" and use a comma instead of a period at the end of a sentence. They also misspell the word \"signed\" as \"sign in.\" Therefore, I would give this section a score of 1.\n\nSCORE: 11/15\n\nOverall, the student's response could benefit from more development and detail, clearer organization, and more attention to conventions.

Here's my detailed evaluation of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and the ideas are developed with specific, relevant details. The student effectively conveys the sense of anticipation and excitement associated with waiting for something they desire. However, the story could benefit from a clearer connection to the concept of patience.

The transitions between ideas are smooth, and the student effectively uses connective language to tie the events together. However, the organization could benefit from a clearer sense of closure, as the ending feels a bit abrupt.

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my detailed evaluation of the student's response based on the provided rubric:\n\nIdeas (Score 4/6):\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide specific details about their experience teaching their younger brother how to catch a football. However, the story is not fully developed, as the student only provides a few specific examples and does not expand on them. Additionally, the story lacks a clear climax or resolution, as the student simply states that their brother finally caught the ball without describing the moment in detail.\n\nOrganization (Score 2/3):\nThe student's organization is logical, but the connections between ideas and events are not always clear. For example, the student jumps abruptly from describing their family members' activities to talking about their younger brother's struggle to catch the ball. Additionally, the student does not provide a clear transition between the different parts of the story.\n\nStyle (Score 2/3):\nThe student's command of language is adequate, but there are some areas where it could be improved. For example, the student uses repetitive phrases such as \"I knew he could do it\" and \"I was really proud of him.\" Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to make the story more engaging. However, the student does use some effective sentence structure and word choice, such as when they describe their brother's excitement after catching the ball.\n\nConventions (Score 3/3):\nThe student consistently uses conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. There are no obvious errors in these areas, and the student's writing is easy to read and understand.\n\nBased on the rubric, I would give the student's response a score of 10/15. The student's ideas are somewhat focused and developed, but could benefit from more specific details and a clearer climax. The organization is logical, but could benefit from clearer connections between ideas and events. The student's command of language is adequate, but could be improved with more descriptive language and varied sentence structure. Finally, the conventions are consistently applied, but there are no opportunities for the student to demonstrate exceptional mastery of language conventions.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",
