Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online.

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

However, there are areas where the response can be improved and developed further. Here's a detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\n1. Task Completion: The student attempts to address all parts of the question, but some points could be developed more fully. For example, the student mentions cyberbullying and online safety but does not provide specific examples or details.\n2. Organization and Structure: The response is generally well-organized, but the transition between ideas could be smoother. The student jumps directly from discussing cyberbullying to online deals, which could be linked more cohesively.\n3. Reasoning and Evidence: The student provides some persuasive points, such as the potential for cyberbullying, identity theft, and the negative impact of spending too much time online. However, some of the arguments feel list-like, lacking elaboration and specific details. For instance, the student mentions \"all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer\" without exploring this point further.\n4. Language and Style: The writing is generally clear and understandable, but some sentences could be tightened for better flow. The student tends to use simple sentence structures and lacks sophistication in their language use.\n5. Audience Awareness: The student shows some awareness of their audience, addressing the reader directly and using second-person pronouns. However, the tone could be more persuasive and engaging, as the student's language at times sounds overly formal or didactic.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would assess the student's response as follows:\n\nScore Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe student's response shows some effort in taking a position and providing reasons, but the arguments lack depth and specificity. While the student is aware of their audience and uses appropriate language, the overall organization and development of the response are not fully satisfactory.\n\nSCORE: 3/6\n\nThe areas where the student could improve include providing more specific examples and details to support their points, developing a more cohesive structure, and using more sophisticated language to engage the reader.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's.

Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

However, the response lacks a comprehensive analysis of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, and the connections made could be more developed and explicit.\n\nThe response starts by acknowledging that the protagonist encountered difficulties during his journey, which is an appropriate observation. The student then highlights two specific challenges faced by the cyclist: taking directions from the old men and running out of water. This is a good start, as it addresses the question's demand to explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully develop how these challenges are related to the story's setting. For example, the student could have explored how the old men's advice led the cyclist down a detour and caused him to become dehydrated, thus further emphasizing the negative impact of relying on unreliable sources. Additionally, the response does not consider other features of the setting, such as the desert environment and the absence of signs or buildings, that may have contributed to the cyclist's difficulties.\n\nMoreover, the response could benefit from more detailed connections to the text. For instance, the student could have directly quoted the lines \"What I shouldn't have done was to let them see my map\" and \"There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind\" to support their analysis. This would have allowed for a clearer connection between the text and the student's responses.\n\nIn conclusion, while the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the text and its challenges, it lacks a comprehensive analysis of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

The student also mentions the irony of the abandoned juice factory, which serves as a stark contrast to the cyclist's depleted state.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from more detailed explanation of how these features affect the cyclist.

For instance, the student cites the sign \"ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT\" and the cyclist's slow speed, which suggests that the setting is affecting him. This is a good start, as it addresses the question directly.\n\nHowever, the student's response could benefit from more support from the text. For example, the student quotes the cyclist's statement \"Sometimes life can be so cruel,\" but does not fully explain why this is a result of the setting. Additionally, the student's analysis of the cyclist's reliance on sucking on stones to take his mind off thirst is not fully developed. While it is mentioned in the text, the student does not fully explore why this is a result of the setting or how it affects the cyclist.\n\nFurthermore, the student's response could benefit from more clarity and organization. The student jumps between different aspects of the text without fully connecting them.

However, their response is largely based on a literal interpretation of the text, and they do not fully connect their support to a clear conclusion or assertion about the text.\n\nHere's the student's answer, with my comments and questions inserted:\n\n\"The setting in the story 'Rough Road Ahead' affect the author in a big way.

After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope.\"\n\nOkay, let's start with the first issue I see: the student is focusing on the absence of things (i.e., \"no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind\") rather than the specific features of the setting that affect the author. While it's true that the author feels hopeless and loses trust, we need to look closer at the text to understand why.\n\nNext, the student mentions the \"old juice factory\" and how it seemed like something was happening in the author's favor. However, they fail to explain why this might have given the author hope or how it relates to the overall themes of the story.\n\nFinally, the student concludes that the author's loss of hope is due to the fact that the juice factory was abandoned. While this is a correct observation, the student doesn't fully explore why this might be significant or how it contributes to the author's overall experience.\n\nNow, let me turn to the rubric.

The question asks the student to explain why the author concludes the story with the final paragraph and to provide details and examples from the story that support their ideas.

The question asks the student to explain why the author concludes the story with the paragraph about Saeng taking the test again. The student's response does address this question, albeit in a relatively straightforward manner.\n\nNext, let's consider whether the response uses expressed and implied information from the text. The student's response is based on the information in the last paragraph of the story, where Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring. This is an expressed aspect of the text, as it is directly stated. The student's response also implies that the test is an important part of Saeng's life or tradition, which is supported by the context of the story.\n\nNow, let's assess whether the response clarifies and extends understanding beyond the literal. The student's response is somewhat limited in this regard, as it does not offer a nuanced or detailed explanation of why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.

The student has attempted to address the question and has identified some reasons why the author concluded the story with the final paragraph. However, the response is limited in its depth and breadth of understanding, and there are some inaccuracies and misinterpretations that need to be addressed.\n\nThe student's response can be broken down into the following points:\n\n1. The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girl's confidence in herself.\n2. It gives her enough time to get ready for the next test.\n3. She knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.\n\nNow, I'll address each point and provide feedback based on the rubric criteria:\n\n1. The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girl's confidence in herself.\n\nThis point is partially correct. The author does show Saeng's confidence in herself, but the main reason for concluding the story with this sentence is to indicate Saeng's determination to take the test again in the spring. The sentence is not solely about Saeng's confidence, but rather about her resolve to prepare herself for the next test.\n\n2. It gives her enough time to get ready for the next test.\n\nThis point is incorrect. The conclusion of the story does not mention anything about Saeng having enough time to prepare for the next test. In fact, the story suggests that Saeng has already failed the test once and is still struggling with her adjustment to the new environment. The focus of the final paragraph is on Saeng's determination to take the test again in the spring, rather than her preparation for it.\n\n3. She knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.\n\nThis point is partially correct. Saeng does say that she will be ready when her hibiscus plant starts to bud, but the story does not suggest that the plant's budding is directly related to Saeng's readiness for the test. Rather, the plant serves as a symbol of Saeng's resilience and determination to thrive in her new environment, despite the challenges she faces.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the text, but there are some inaccuracies and misinterpretations that need to be addressed. Based on the rubric criteria, I would score this response as follows:\n\nSCORE: 2/3\n\nThe student has attempted to address the question, but there are some limitations in their understanding of the text. Specifically, the response is weak in its breadth of understanding and is marred by some inaccuracies and misinterpretations. However, the student has demonstrated some awareness of the text and has made an effort to connect the conclusion of the story to Saeng's confidence and determination.

The student's response is written in a clear and legible handwriting, with no spelling or grammar mistakes.\n2. The response begins by mentioning the author's nationality, family, and home, but it quickly becomes apparent that the student has not fully understood the memoir.\n3. The student states that the author is \"proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it,\" but the memoir does not mention the author's pride or fear related to their nationality.\n4. The student also mentions that the author is married and lives in a @DATE1 apartment in Newark, New Jersey, but the memoir does not mention the author's marital status or the date they moved to the United States.\n5. The student goes on to mention the author's family and neighborhood, but their information is not accurate. The memoir states that the author's parents were both from Cuba and arrived in the United States in 1956, but the student incorrectly states that the author's parents were from different countries and that the author is proud of their nationality.\n6. The student also mentions the author's childhood and neighborhood, but again, their information is not accurate. The memoir states that the author grew up in a close-knit community of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants, but the student incorrectly states that the neighborhood was made up of Cubans and @CAPS1.\n7. The student's response briefly mentions the author's love of cooking and music, but they do not provide any specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support their answer.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the mood created by the author. The response includes little or no information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nThe student's response is largely inaccurate and does not provide a clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author. They have misinterpreted several key details from the memoir and have not provided any specific examples or quotes to support their answer.

The response includes little or no information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nThe student's response is quite brief and lacks specific details from the memoir. The response focuses on the idea that the author's mood is \"sad\" because they are remembering a good time that has passed, but this interpretation is not supported by specific evidence from the text. Additionally, the response mentions the author's happiness and gratitude, but these emotions are not necessarily conveyed in the memoir.\n\nTo receive a higher score, the student could have provided more specific examples from the text to support their analysis of the author's mood.

They highlight several aspects of the memoir that contribute to the warm and happy atmosphere, such as the sense of community, the author's love for the neighborhood, and the presence of extended family. The response is both complete and accurate, providing specific examples from the text to support their analysis.

This is an accurate representation of the challenges outlined in the excerpt. However, the response could benefit from more specific detail regarding each obstacle.\n\nThe first obstacle, safety, is mentioned but not fully expounded upon. The excerpt highlights the risk of dirigibles using hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and the potential for disaster if they were to dock at the Empire State Building. The student should have delved deeper into this specific safety concern and its implications.\n\nThe second obstacle, Nature, is somewhat better addressed. The student mentions the violent air currents and shifting winds that would make it difficult to moor the dirigibles, which is a relevant aspect highlighted in the excerpt. However, the response could be more specific about the nature of these winds and how they would make mooring the dirigibles challenging.\n\nThe third obstacle, THE LAW, is also generally accurate but could benefit from more context. The student mentions that dirigibles were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas, but does not explain the reasoning behind this law or its significance in relation to the Empire State Building.\n\nThroughout the response, the student uses correct syntax and grammar but could benefit from greater coherence and organization.

The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction.

The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt.\n\nStep 1: The student accurately identifies the safety concerns regarding hydrogen-filled dirigibles, noting that the Hindenburg disaster could have been worse if it had occurred above a densely populated area.\n\nStep 2: The student correctly mentions the unpredictable winds at the height of the Empire State Building as another safety concern.\n\nStep 3: The student acknowledges the legal obstacle of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the Empire State Building.\n\nStep 4: The student provides specific examples of the challenges faced by the builders, including the difficulty of mooring the dirigibles due to shifting winds and the need for specialized equipment to handle the weight and pressure of the dirigibles.\n\nStep 5: The student accurately concludes that the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were too great to make the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock there a practical reality.\n\nOverall, the student's response is a complete and accurate description of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, derived from specific information in the excerpt. The response is worthy of a score of 4/4, the maximum score for this question.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe student's response is strengthened by the incorporation of specific details from the excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen-filled dirigibles and the unpredictable winds at the height of the Empire State Building. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the text and the obstacles faced by the builders.\n\nThe student's response is also well-organized and easy to follow, with each step logically building on the previous one to form a cohesive and comprehensive description of the obstacles faced by the builders.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided rubric, I would award the student a score of 4/4 for their response, indicating a complete and accurate understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.\n\nSCORE: 4/4",

The story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, but it lacks specific and relevant details to fully develop the idea. For example, the student mentions waiting for the CAPS (Child Assault Prevention and Support) staff to come back, but the story could benefit from more details about what they did during that time, how they felt while waiting, and what they learned from the experience.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's response is logically sequenced, but it lacks clear connections between ideas and/or events. The story jumps abruptly from the CAPS appointment to the staff member's compliment, without providing a clear transition or explanation of how the patient waiting paid off. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clear beginning, middle, and end, as well as more varied sentence structure to enhance the reader's engagement.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's use of language is limited and may hinder support for the writer's purpose and audience.

Somebody that\u0092s patient experiences difficulties without complaining. There was one @CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking my friends and I to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I called many friends, and told them if they wanted to go.  Meanwhile, we packed up some water bottles and hopped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OMG! Look at those big roller coasters. One of my friends shouted out. There we were at @CAPS1 @CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @CAPS3. The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go on it. Wow! The line is huge. We all said.

We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn\u0092t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it.

The story is somewhat focused on the topic, but there are some tangents and unnecessary details that detract from the main point.

The student's ideas are thoroughly developed and engaging, making the story easy to follow.\n\nOrganization (3):\nThe story is logically sequenced and well-organized, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The connections between ideas and events are clear and effective, making it easy for the reader to follow the student's train of thought. However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and varying sentence lengths to add more depth and interest to the story.\n\nStyle (2):\nWhile the student demonstrates adequate command of language, including effective word choice and clear sentences, there is room for improvement in terms of varied sentence structure and word choice. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for increased clarity and readability. Additionally, the student's writing is somewhat inconsistent in terms of capitalization and punctuation, which detracts from the overall effectiveness of the story.\n\nConventions (2):\nThe student demonstrates adequate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation, but there are some inconsistencies and errors throughout the story.

However, the story is quite brief and lacks specific details that would make it more engaging and memorable. For example, the student could have described the atmosphere of the restaurant, the expressions of the waiters, or the emotions they felt while waiting. Additionally, the story jumps abruptly from the wait to the food arriving, without any transition or detail about how the student felt during the wait.\n\nORGANIZATION:\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, but could benefit from more connections between ideas and/or events.\n\nThe student's story follows a clear chronological order, with a beginning, middle, and end. However, the transitions between sections could be smoother, and the story could benefit from more connections between the different elements. For example, the student could have linked the wait to their growing hunger, or the relief they felt when the food finally arrived.\n\nSTYLE:\nThe student's command of language is adequate, but could be more effective in supporting their purpose and audience.\n\nThe student uses appropriate grammar and spelling, but their word choice is somewhat limited and lacks variety. The sentences are clear and easy to understand, but could benefit from more complex sentence structures and imagery. Additionally, the student's purpose and audience are not explicitly stated, which makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of their writing.\n\nCONVENTIONS:\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but could benefit from more consistency and attention to detail.\n\nThe student consistently uses Standard English grammar and spelling, but there are a few errors throughout the story. For example, there is a missing apostrophe in the word \"CAPS1\" and a missing period at the end of one sentence. Additionally, the student could benefit from more attention to detail in terms of capitalization and punctuation.\n\nOVERALL GRADE:\nBased on the rubric, I would give the student a score of 8/15. The student's story demonstrates some understanding of the topic of patience, but could benefit from more thorough development of ideas, smoother organization, more effective language, and greater attention to conventions.\n\nSCORE: 8/15",

Even though we were suppose to go\"\n\nNow, let me use the rubric to evaluate the student's response.\n\nIdeas:\n\n* Focus on the topic: 2/6 (The story is slightly focused on the topic of patience, but it deviates slightly with the details about the grandparents over sleeping and the suitcases.)\n* Originality and breadth of ideas: 2/6 (The story is a common experience that many people can relate to, but it doesn't offer any particularly original or unique insights.)\n\nOrganization:\n\n* Logical sequence of ideas: 2/3 (The story follows a logical sequence, but the transition between the beginning and the middle is somewhat abrupt.)\n* Connection between ideas and events: 1/3 (The connection between the ideas and events is somewhat weak, as the story jumps from the grandparents over sleeping to the suitcases without much explanation.)\n\nStyle:\n\n* Word choice and sentence structure: 2/6 (The student uses slightly varied sentence structures, but the word choice is somewhat limited and lacks precise language.)\n\nConventions:\n\n* Consistency of grammatical structures: 2/3 (The student demonstrates adequate consistency in using grammatical structures, but there are a few errors in punctuation and capitalization.)\n\nTotal score: 2/15\n\nBased on the rubric, I would award the student a score of 2/15. Here's my rationale:\n\n* Ideas: The student's ideas are somewhat focused on the topic, but they deviate slightly with the details about the grandparents over sleeping and the suitcases. The story is somewhat common and doesn't offer any particularly original or unique insights. Score: 2/6\n* Organization: The student's organization is somewhat logical, but the transition between the beginning and the middle is somewhat abrupt. The connection between the ideas and events is somewhat weak. Score: 2/3\n* Style: The student's style is somewhat varied, but the word choice is limited and lacks precise language. Score: 2/6\n* Conventions: The student demonstrates adequate consistency in using grammatical structures, but there are a few errors in punctuation and capitalization. Score: 2/3\n\nTotal score: 2/15\n\nTherefore, I would award the student a score of 2/15.",

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",

I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!
