        "marker": " Here's a step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\n1. The student begins by addressing the newspaper and stating their opinion on the effects of computers on people. They argue that computers benefit society because they allow for faster and easier communication.\n2. The student provides two reasons to support their argument: the ability to email family and friends anytime and the ability to access various websites and services.\n3. However, the student also acknowledges that spending too much time on the computer can be a bad thing. They suggest that people should not spend too much time on the computer and should also engage in other activities like exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.\n4. The student concludes by reiterating their opinion that computers benefit society and expressing gratitude for the convenience they offer.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the student's response using the provided rubric:\n\n* The response takes a clear position (score point 4) and provides some support (score point 3) but lacks development and specific details.\n* The organization is minimal (score point 3), and the writing is awkward and fragmented (score point 2) with some difficulties in reading and understanding.\n* The student shows little awareness of the audience (score point 2) and does not address the opposing viewpoint.\n* There is no evidence of persuasive elements, such as emotional appeals or rhetorical strategies, to convince the readers to agree with the student's opinion (score point 5).\n\nBased on the above evaluation, I would give the student's response a score of 3/6. The student's response demonstrates some understanding of the topic and offers a few valid points, but it lacks development, organization, and persuasive elements to make it a strong argument.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.",
        "marker": " The student's response is a letter to the editor that argues in favor of the benefits of computers. The response is well-intentioned, but it lacks depth and sophistication in its argumentation.\n\nThe response begins by acknowledging the concerns of those who oppose the use of computers, but it does not address their concerns directly. Instead, it simply lists the benefits of computers, such as hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and communication with family and friends. While these are indeed benefits of computers, the response does not explain why these benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.\n\nThe organization of the response is also lacking. The student jumps abruptly from one benefit to another without connecting them logically. The transitions between sentences are awkward, making the response difficult to follow.\n\nThe language used in the response is simple and lacks sophistication. The student uses short, simple sentences that do not convey complex ideas. There are some grammatical errors, such as \"feal\" instead of \"feel,\" which detract from the overall quality of the response.\n\nThe response does not show a clear awareness of the audience. The student does not address the reader directly, and there is no evidence that the student considered the reader's perspective.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\n* Score Point 3: The response takes a position, but with inadequate support and details. The student provides some general reasons for the benefits of computers, but they are not well-elaborated.\n* Organization: The response shows some organization, but it is not well-developed. The student jumps abruptly from one benefit to another without connecting them logically.\n* Language: The language used in the response is simple and lacks sophistication.\n* Audience awareness: The response does not show a clear awareness of the audience.\n\nSCORE: 3/6\n\nIn conclusion, while the student's response shows some effort, it lacks depth and sophistication in its argumentation. To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific examples and evidence to support their claims, organizing their ideas logically, and using more complex language to convey their ideas effectively. Additionally, the student should consider the reader's perspective and address them directly to make the response more engaging and persuasive.",

Let's analyze the answer using the provided rubric:\n\nScore Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\nThe student's answer barely scratches the surface regarding reasons for utilizing computers. They provide three main points: using computers for help, communication, and receiving important messages. However, these points lack considerable development and specifics, resulting in an underdeveloped response. The student's justifications are minimal and somewhat vague, failing to offer concrete examples or supporting details. The answer is rough and challenging to understand, indicating a lack of awareness of the target audience.\n\nScore: 1/6\n\nAlthough the student's answer may appear underdeveloped, it attempts to provide a few arguments supporting the use of computers. Instead of merely listing or generally discussing these points, let's imagine how the response could be improved.\n\nScore Point 2: An underdeveloped response that may or may not take a position.\n\nThe student's answer does not offer enough information to consider it a minimally-developed response. Even though it attempts to provide a few reasons for using computers, the details are incredibly general and poorly elaborated upon. The answer lacks a clear structure and appears fragmented. The writing is awkward, with minimal evidence of sophisticated language or transitions. There is little consideration for the target audience.\n\nScore: 2/6\n\nLet's assume the student's response demonstrated a more thoughtful position with slightly more detailed arguments.\n\nScore Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe student's answer exhibits some improvement but remains limited. They provide three arguments for using computers, such as accessing helpful information, connecting with others, and receiving critical messages. However, these points are still underdeveloped and lack specific details. The response reveals some organization yet requires more cohesion and better transitions. The writing remains relatively awkward, with limited awareness of the target audience.\n\nScore: 3/6\n\nNow, imagine the student has expanded their answer, offering more detailed and specific reasons while improving organization and writing style.\n\nScore Point 4: A somewhat-developed response that takes a position and provides adequate support.\n\nThe student's answer exhibits notable improvement. They provide three well-elaborated reasons for using computers, including accessing educational resources, communicating with others, and receiving important information. Each point contains specific examples and supporting details, making the argument more convincing. The response reveals satisfactory organization and better transitional language. The student demonstrates some awareness of the target audience, addressing the readers directly and emphasizing the significance of computer literacy.\n\nScore: 4/6\n\nAssuming the student further refines their response, providing more sophisticated language, organizational clarity, and heightened audience awareness, we can evaluate it at the next level.\n\nScore Point 5: A developed response that takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response showcases substantial improvement, offering a well-structured and persuasive argument. They thoroughly elaborate on their reasons for utilizing computers, including leveraging technology for education and communication, emphasizing the importance of computer literacy, and addressing potential concerns about excessive screen time. Each point contains specific examples and supporting details, providing credibility. The response exhibits strong organization, featuring a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writing is fluent, with sophisticated transitions and a demonstrated awareness of the target audience.\n\nScore: 5/6\n\nSCORE: 4/6\n\nThe student's response, while displaying some irregularities, ultimately presents a somewhat-developed argument that justifies the use of computers.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",
        "marker": " The student's response is a well-developed argument that effectively uses reasons, details, and persuasive language to support their position. The writer begins by acknowledging both the positive and negative effects of computers on people but then clearly states their opinion that computers have a bigger positive impact than negative.\n\nThe first reason the writer provides is that computers offer a wealth of knowledge and learning opportunities, such as researching for school projects, learning about faraway places and people, and improving hand-eye coordination through games. The writer also acknowledges the concern about spending too much time on the computer and not enough time exercising or interacting with family and friends. However, they effectively counter this concern by suggesting that a limited amount of time spent on the computer each day can be balanced with outdoor activities and socializing.\n\nThe writer's use of details and examples is one of the strengths of their response. They provide specific examples of how they use the computer for learning and relaxation, such as playing video games like bubble spinner and using Facebook to connect with friends and family. They also mention how the computer offers a way to see nature and talk to people from all over the world through videos on YouTube and Google. These examples effectively illustrate how the computer can provide benefits that would be difficult or impossible to achieve without it.\n\nThe writer's organization and style are also well-developed. They have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and they use transitional phrases to connect their ideas effectively. The writer's tone is informative and persuasive, and they address the reader directly, inviting them to consider their points. There are a few minor errors in grammar and punctuation, but overall, the response is well-written and easy to understand.\n\nGiven the strengths of the student's response, I would give it a score of 5 out of 6. The writer takes a clear position, provides effective support, and uses persuasive language. However, to achieve a perfect score, the writer could further develop their reasons and details, provide more nuanced arguments, and show an even greater awareness of the audience's needs and concerns.\n\nSCORE: 5/6",

        "essay": "Do you think computers are handy? I do believe they are very handy. Computers offer many things like Online shopping, @CAPS1 and even @CAPS2.V. Online shopping can be very helpful. Say you don\u0092@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point. Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.",
        "marker": " The student's response is a letter to the editor that argues in favor of the usefulness of computers. The letter presents several points that support the idea that computers are helpful, such as the ability to shop online, communicate with others through social media and messaging, and access various forms of entertainment.\n\n Based on the provided rubric, I would give the student's response a score of 3 out of 6. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The response takes a position but offers minimal support. The student provides a few examples of how computers can be helpful, but the details are general and lack specific elaboration. For example, the student mentions that computers offer online shopping, but they don't provide any specific examples of how this can be useful.\n2. The response shows little organization. The student jumps between different topics (online shopping, social media, messaging, and entertainment) without any clear connection between them. It's difficult to follow the student's train of thought, and the letter feels like a list of random points rather than a cohesive argument.\n3. The response is awkward and fragmented. The student uses short sentences and bullet points, which makes the letter feel disjointed. There are also some grammatical errors (e.g., \"Almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses\" instead of \"Almost everyone in the world uses\") that detract from the overall effectiveness of the argument.\n4. The response shows some awareness of the audience. The student uses phrases like \"you @MONTH1 believe\" and \"now you have read,\" which suggests that they are addressing a specific reader. However, the student could have done more to tailor the letter to the audience's interests and concerns.\n\nOverall, the student's response is underdeveloped and lacks specific details and organization. While it's clear that the student wants to argue in favor of computers, they don't provide enough persuasive evidence to support their position. With some revision and expansion, the letter could be more effective in convincing readers of the benefits of computers.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

The student mentions that computers are bad for society, but they do not explicitly state their position until the final paragraph. It would be beneficial for the student to state their position at the beginning of the letter to give the reader a clear understanding of their stance.\n\nSecond, the response lacks specific details to support the student's claims. The first reason given is that computers can lead to obesity, but there is no evidence or data provided to back up this claim.

The third point about managing finances is the most developed, but it only mentions that many people pay their bills online and manage their money on the computer without explaining how this has positively impacted their lives.\n\nScore Point 2: The response provides some general reasons for why computers are beneficial, but they are not elaborated upon in a meaningful way. The letter mentions that computers allow people to communicate with others, access information, and manage their finances, but it does not provide specific details or examples to support these claims. There is no clear organization to the response, and it jumps between different points without connecting them logically.\n\nScore Point 3: The response provides some details to support its claims, but they are still general and lack specific examples.

However, the letter does provide some specific statistics to support its claims about people paying their bills online, which is a positive aspect.\n\nScore Point 4: The response provides adequate support for its claims and some evidence of organization. The letter begins by introducing the benefit of video chat, then transitions to discussing the ability to access information, and ends by discussing the convenience of paying bills online. However, the transitions between these points could be smoother, and the response could benefit from more specific examples and details. The letter also shows some awareness of the audience, addressing the reader directly and using language that is appropriate for a letter to the editor.\n\nScore Point 5: The response provides well-elaborated reasons to support its claims and shows strong organization. The letter clearly expresses the benefits of computers, such as the ability to communicate with others, access a wide range of information, and manage finances. It provides specific details and examples to support these claims, such as the statistic that 25% of people in the United States use video chat. The response is also well-organized, using transitional phrases to connect the different points. The letter shows a consistent awareness of the audience throughout, addressing the reader directly and using appropriate language.\n\nScore Point 6: The response exhibits a highly developed argument, providing specific and persuasive details to support its claims. The letter begins with a strong introduction that hooks the reader's attention and ends with a clear conclusion that summarizes the main points. The response provides specific examples and statistics to support each of its claims, such as the benefit of video chat for people who have family members living in different parts of the world.

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

        "essay": "Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2.

Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

The student then goes on to explain how the cyclist is affected by the setting, citing examples from the essay. For instance, the student mentions how the cyclist's speed is greatly affected by the rough road ahead and how the heat and dehydration make him feel hopeless. These examples show that the student has read and understood the text on a basic level.\n\nHowever, the response does not go beyond the literal meaning of the text. The student does not clarify or extend the understanding of the text beyond the obvious. For example, the student could have discussed how the harsh terrain and weather conditions symbolize the challenges the cyclist faces on his journey, or how the setting affects the cyclist's mental state.\n\nAdditionally, the response lacks organization and clarity. The student jumps between different ideas without connecting them coherently. It would have been better to provide a clear introduction, body, and conclusion that are well-connected and easy to follow.\n\nTherefore, based on the rubric provided, I would give the student's response a score of 2/3.

They also mention that the absence of any buildings, cars, or structures around the author makes him lose hope and trust. This is supported by the text when the author states, \"With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill\" (Kurmaskie 240). The student also recognizes that the author's loss of hope is evident when he talks about how he's going to die and how he's lost trust in the old men.\n\nHowever, the student's response does not fully clarify and extend understanding beyond the literal. For instance, they do not explain how the setting contributes to the author's changed attitude towards the old men's advice. Additionally, the student's statement that the author \"loses trust in the old men\" is not supported by the text. While the author does mention that he regrets listening to the old men, he does not explicitly state that he loses trust in them.\n\nFurthermore, the student's conclusion does not fully summarize their points nor relates back to the question.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples and analysis of how the setting affects the cyclist's journey.\n\nFirstly, the response states that the cyclist had a rough time due to the hot and dry conditions, but it would be more effective to provide specific examples from the text that support this claim. For instance, the response could mention how the cyclist's water supply was depleted, causing him to conserve it and ride inward for an hour or so, or how the heat caused him to feel dehydrated and fatigued.\n\nSecondly, the response mentions the presence of a snake and hills, which affects the cyclist's journey by making it more challenging. However, the response could elaborate more on how these obstacles impact the cyclist's physical and mental state. For example, the response could describe how the sight of a snake and the steep hills caused the cyclist to feel anxious and afraid, or how the cyclist had to use extra energy to climb the hills, further depleting his water supply.\n\nLastly, the response could benefit from providing a clearer conclusion that summarizes how the setting affects the cyclist's journey.

Instead, it mentions showing loyalty to people they know. While loyalty and patience can be related virtues, the answer does not clearly focus on the topic of patience. Therefore, the score for ideas is 0.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's answer lacks organization and connections between ideas. The statement is a single sentence that does not provide any specific details or examples, and does not clearly convey a sense of logical sequencing. Therefore, the score for organization is 0.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's answer demonstrates limited use of language, with a lack of variety in word choice and sentences. The sentence structure is simple, and the language does not effectively support the writer's purpose or audience. Therefore, the score for style is 1.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's answer contains errors in grammar, spelling, and capitalization. For example, \"peolpe\" should be spelled \"people,\" and \"no\" should be spelled \"know.\" Additionally, the sentence does not begin with a capital letter, and there is no punctuation at the end of the sentence.

The student mentions that they were patient and didn't complain while waiting, and their foster mom appreciated their patience.\n\nStep 2: Assessing the Ideas (Score 2/6)\n\nThe student's response contains some relevant details about the situation, such as the location and the reason for the wait. However, the ideas are not thoroughly developed, and the story is not well-focused on the topic of patience. The student could have expanded on their feelings during the wait, or described how they maintained their patience, or even contrasted their experience with a time when they were not patient. Therefore, I would score this category as 2/6.\n\nStep 3: Assessing the Organization (Score 2/3)\n\nThe organization of the student's response is logical, but it could be improved. The student starts by describing the situation and then jumps to their foster mom's reaction. It would have been better if they had described the events in a more linear fashion, such as first describing the wait, then their feelings during the wait, and finally their foster mom's reaction. Therefore, I would score this category as 2/3.\n\nStep 4: Assessing the Style (Score 1/3)\n\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but it could be more varied and sophisticated. The sentences are mostly simple, and there is a lack of descriptive vocabulary. The student could have used more precise language to describe their feelings and the situation. Therefore, I would score this category as 1/3.\n\nStep 5: Assessing the Conventions (Score 2/3)\n\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but there are some errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation. For example, there are missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and missing commas. Therefore, I would score this category as 2/3.\n\nStep 6: Calculating the total score\n\nIdeas: 2/6\nOrganization: 2/3\nStyle: 1/3\nConventions: 2/3\nTotal score: 7/15\n\nRationale:\nThe student's response could have been more focused on the topic of patience and developed more specific and detailed descriptions of their experiences. The organization could have been improved by describing the events in a more linear fashion. The student's use of language could have been more varied and sophisticated, and there were some errors in conventions.\n\nSCORE: 7/15",

        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\n\nThe student's response provides several examples of how their family members exhibit patience in various situations. The ideas are somewhat focused on the topic, but they could be more specific and thoroughly developed. For example, the student could have provided more details about their father's experience of being deployed and how he copes with the long separation from his family. Additionally, the student could have expanded on their mother's frustration with her co-workers and how she manages to remain patient in those situations. The student's response lacks specific details and instead, provides a list of different situations where family members have been patient. Therefore, I would score this category a 4.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's response is organized in a logical manner, with each paragraph focusing on a different family member and their exhibitions of patience. However, the connections between ideas and events could be clearer and more logically sequenced. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from talking about their father's deployment to their mother's frustration with her co-workers without any transition. Moreover, the student could have used transitional phrases to connect the different paragraphs and make the response flow better. Therefore, I would score this category a 2.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's response demonstrates some command of language, but it could be improved. The sentence structure is mostly simple, and the vocabulary is not very varied. For example, the student uses the word \"patient\" repeatedly without much modification. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as the lack of articles (e.g., \"my family is really patient wether its sitting in the office or deployed to a new country my family is always patient\"). To improve the style, the student could have used more descriptive language to paint a picture of the situations they are describing. Therefore, I would score this category a 2.\n\nConventions:\n\nThe student's response demonstrates adequate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are a few errors, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and inconsistent punctuation. For example, in the second sentence, \"My dad has to be patient because when he gets deployed to a new country he has to wait such a long time to come back and see his family again,\" the verb tense changes from past to present. To improve the conventions, the student should proofread the response carefully to correct the errors. Therefore, I would score this category a 2.\n\nSCORE: 10/15\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response could be improved in terms of providing more specific details, better organization, and increased descriptive language. However, the response demonstrates some understanding of the topic and adequate use of conventions.",

The student's response only briefly touches on the idea of patience when they mention that they blacked out and hit their chin on the door while leaving the hospital. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2, as the ideas are only minimally focused on the topic and are not thoroughly developed.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's response is somewhat organized, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the connection between ideas and events is not always logical, and the transitions between sentences are sometimes awkward. For example, the student jumps abruptly from talking about being a patient to blacking out and hitting their chin on the door without much of a transition. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2, as the organization and connections between ideas and events are logically sequenced, but could be improved.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's response uses simple sentence structures and basic vocabulary, which does not vary much throughout the response. The word choice is generally effective, but there are a few instances of awkward phrasing, such as \"I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot.\" This sentence could be rephrased for clarity and smoothness. Additionally, there are a few errors in capitalization and punctuation, such as lack of articles and incorrect use of commas. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 1, as the command of language is limited and may hinder support for the writer's purpose and audience.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's response has some errors in conventions of Standard English, such as inconsistent use of capitalization, incorrect use of commas, and missing articles. For example, the student writes \"I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot\" instead of \"I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time, so my mom took me to the hospital and I got a shot.\" Therefore, I would give this section a score of 1, as the use of conventions of Standard English is limited and may hinder support for the writer's purpose and audience.\n\nSCORE: 6/15\n\nOverall, the student's response could benefit from more attention to the prompt and more development of ideas.

Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4 out of 6 for ideas.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe organization of the response is clear and logically sequenced. The student starts by describing the catalog and the goalkeeper jersey they wanted, then move on to describing their mother's response, and finally, the arrival of the jersey. However, the connections between ideas and events could have been stronger. For example, the student could have described how they felt when their mother said it was a bit pricy, or how they felt when they finally received the jersey. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 3 out of 3 for organization.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's response demonstrates some command of language, including effective word choice and clear sentences.

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas (Score 4/6):\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide some specific details about their experience waiting to play a video game. However, the story is not thoroughly developed, and some parts feel a bit disconnected. For example, the student mentions that they had to wait for four hours to play the game, but they don't explain how they felt during that time or what they did to pass the time. Additionally, the story doesn't have a clear resolution or lesson learned, which makes it feel a bit incomplete.\n\nOrganization (Score 3/3):\nThe student's response has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and they use transitional phrases to connect their ideas. However, some parts of the story feel a bit disjointed, and it's not always clear how the student's experiences relate to the topic of patience.\n\nStyle (Score 2/3):\nThe student's writing is clear and easy to understand, but it lacks variety in sentence structure and word choice. The student uses some descriptive language, such as \"really sad and mad,\" but there are moments when the writing feels a bit flat and unengaged. Additionally, there are a few grammatical errors, such as \"preaty\" instead of \"pretty\" and \"complained\" instead of \"complain.\"\n\nConventions (Score 2/3):\nThe student's response has some errors in grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. For example, they use \"they're\" instead of \"there are,\" \"it's\" instead of \"it is,\" and \"NUM1\" instead of writing out the number. Additionally, there are some run-on sentences and lack of commas in places where they are needed.\n\nOverall, I would give the student's response a score of 8/15. While the student has some good ideas and organization, their writing could benefit from more attention to detail, syntax, and conventions. Additionally, the story could be more fully developed and have a clearer resolution or lesson learned.\n\nSCORE: 8/15",

        "essay": "I\u0092m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I\u0092m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to assess and grade the student's answer using the provided rubric. Here's my step-by-step review:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's answer tells a story that is somewhat focused on the topic of patience. The story is about the student's younger sister and how the student is patient with her. The story also includes a conversation between the student and their mother about makeup and practice. However, the story does not fully develop the idea of patience and does not provide specific, relevant details. The student could have expanded on the story by describing specific instances where they had to exercise patience with their sister or when their mother taught them about the importance of patience.\n\nScore: 4/6\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's answer is logically sequenced, but the connections between ideas and events are not always clear. The student jumps from talking about their sister to talking about makeup without much connection. The student could have improved the organization by providing more transitions and connecting the ideas more smoothly.\n\nScore: 2/3\n\nStyle:\nThe student's command of language is adequate, but there are some areas that could be improved. The student uses simple sentences and lacks variety in word choice. For example, the student uses the word \"good\" several times in the story instead of using more descriptive words. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the events.\n\nScore: 2/3\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but there are a few errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. For example, there are missing articles (\"I asked my mom to help me select the best ones!\" instead of \"I asked my mom to help me select the best ones!\"), incorrect verb tenses (\"I asked \u0091@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094\" instead of \"I asked, 'Did you get good at putting makeup?'\"), and missing commas (\".@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\" instead of \".@CAPS4, @CAPS9,\").\n\nScore: 2/3\n\nSCORE: 10/15\n\nOverall, the student's answer could be improved by providing more specific, relevant details, better organization, and a stronger command of language. Additionally, the student should pay closer attention to conventions to ensure that there are no errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation.",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
