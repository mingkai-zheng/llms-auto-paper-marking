Here is my evaluation:\nSCORE: 2/6\nThe student's response partially takes a position on the given topic, but it lacks adequate support and details to persuade the reader. While the student acknowledges that computers have both positive and negative effects, they do not provide enough evidence to justify their stance. Here are some specific areas of concern:\n1. Lack of details: The student fails to provide specific examples or instances to support their statement that computers help people learn about faraway places and people. Their reason for this claim is too general, which makes it difficult to understand the scope of their argument.\n2. Minimal organization: The student's response is fragmented and lacks a clear structure. There is no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, which makes it challenging for the reader to follow their line of thinking.\n3. Lack of awareness of audience: The student does not seem to consider their audience when writing their response. They use simple language and fail to address any counterarguments or concerns that readers might have.\nWhile the student's response shows some effort, it falls short of providing a well-developed and persuasive argument. To improve their grade, they should focus on adding more details, providing a clear structure, and considering their audience's perspective.\nTherefore, I award the student a score of 2/6.",

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

However, the student's support for this position is somewhat limited. They provide a few general reasons, such as computers allowing people to learn about faraway places and people, but these reasons are not fully elaborated. Additionally, the student's use of evidence is inconsistent, with some sources cited (e.g., Facebook, bubble spinner) but not fully developed.\nOne strength of the student's response is their awareness of the audience, as they acknowledge the potential concerns of experts regarding excessive computer use. However, the student fails to address these concerns in a meaningful way, leaving their argument somewhat simplistic and incomplete.\nTo improve their answer, the student could have provided more specific details and examples to support their position. For instance, they could have discussed the benefits of digital communication tools like Facebook in terms of keeping friends and family connected, or the ways in which online educational resources can enhance traditional classroom learning. The student could also have addresser the potential negative effects of computer use more directly, such as the impact of screen time on mental health and the loss of face-to-face communication skills.\nIn conclusion, while the student's response takes a clear position and shows some awareness of the audience, it lacks depth and persuasive power.

While their response does contain some positive elements, such as an awareness of potential negative effects, their lack of a clear position and weak organization undermine their argument's relevance and persuasiveness.",

People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games.

You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17.

        "marker": " After reviewing the student's response, I have assessed their work based on the provided rubric and awarded the following score:\nSCORE: 3/6\n\nThe student's response is primarily focused on listing the various ways in which computers are convenient and helpful, without providing a clear position or persuasive support. While they do mention some potential advantages of computers, such as online shopping and communication, they fail to fully develop these ideas or offer any evidence to support their claims. As a result, their response remains superficial and lacks depth.\nHere are some specific areas where the student could improve:\n1. The student could have taken a clearer position on the topic of the effects of computers on society. While they mention that computers are helpful and convenient, they do not provide any specific reasons or evidence to support this claim.\n2. The student could have provided more specific examples and details to support their arguments. For instance, they could have discussed the potential impact of computers on face-to-face communication, exercise, or mental health.\n3. The student could have shown more awareness of their audience and tailored their tone and language accordingly. While they do use some transition words and phrases, their writing remains quite generic and lacks any real connection with the reader.\nOverall, the student's response is a good effort, but it needs more development and support to be considered a strong, persuasive argument. With some revisions to address these areas, the student could improve their score significantly.",

Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

        "marker": " After a thorough evaluation of the student's response, I have awarded the following score: SCORE: 4/6. Here is my detailed rationale for the grade:\nScore Point 1:\nThe student's response takes a clear position in favor of the positive effects of computers on people. However, the argument is not well-supported, and the details provided are general and unelaborated. For example, the student states that computers teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, but these claims are not backed up with any specific examples or evidence. Moreover, the student's argument lacks a clear organizational structure, making it difficult to follow and understand.\nScore Point 2:\nWhile the student provides some reasons for their position, they are not adequately elaborated, and the details given are mostly general and unspecific. For instance, the student cites the testimony of an expert who states that 75% of successful jobs involve some kind of interaction with computers, but this argument is not further developed or supported with any evidence. The student also acknowledges the concerns of some experts about the negative effects of computers, but they do not address these concerns directly or provide any convincing counterarguments.\nScore Point 3:\nThe student's response shows some organization, but the reasons provided for their position are inadequate, and the details are general and unelaborated. For example, the student mentions that computers allow people to talk online with other people and that their sister, who grew up with computers, became a college graduate with excellent computer skills. While these examples may be intended to support the student's position, they do not provide sufficient evidence or elaboration to convince the reader of the positive effects of computers.\nScore Point 4:\nThe student's response takes a clear position and provides some supportive details, but the argument is not fully developed, and the reasons are not adequately elaborated. For example, the student states that online communication allows people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, but they do not provide any specific examples or evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the student's argument lacks a consistent awareness of their audience, which hinders the effectiveness of their appeal.\nScore Point 5:\nThe student's response shows some improvement in their argumentation, but the reasons provided for their position are still not fully developed, and the details are not consistently elaborated. For example, the student cites the example of their sister, who grew up with computers and became a college graduate with excellent computer skills, but they do not provide sufficient additional evidence or elaboration to support this claim. Moreover, the student's argument still lacks a clear organizational structure, which makes it difficult to follow and understand.\nScore Point 6:\nThe student's response takes a clear and thoughtful position, and they provide persuasive support for their argument. The reasons are fully elaborated, and the examples provided are specific and effective. For example, the student cites the testimony of a kid therapist who states that kids who chat with other kids online are generally more social and interactive, and they provide evidence from a study that shows that kids who spend time online are more likely to be engaged in school and have better grades. These examples are well-chosen and convincingly presented, and they demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic.\nIn conclusion, while the student's response shows some improvement over earlier efforts, it still falls short of fully developing their argument and providing persuasive support for their position. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a willingness to engage with the topic and consider different perspectives, which is an important aspect of effective argumentation.",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research.

        "marker": " SCORE: 4/6\nFrom the perspective of the rubric, as I evaluate the student's response to the question, here are the strengths and weaknesses observed:\nStrengths:\n1. The student has taken a clear position on the topic of whether computers benefit or harm society. They argue that computers have a positive effect on people, providing various reasons such as hand-eye coordination, access to information, and socialization. These reasons are somewhat elaborated, and the student provides some specific examples to support their claim.\n2. The student demonstrates some awareness of audience by acknowledging the concerns of experts who are opposed to the use of computers. They address these concerns by emphasizing the benefits of computers and arguing that they are here to stay.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The response lacks depth and detail in several areas. While the student provides some examples to support their position, these examples are often general and not very specific. For instance, they mention sharing information with family and friends online, but offer no examples of how this has happened in their own life or in the lives of others.\n2. The organization of the response is not always clear. The student jumps between different topics, such as the benefit of computers for learning, socializing, and providing news updates, without always connecting these topics logically. This makes the essay feel disjointed and difficult to follow at times.\n3. The use of language is sometimes awkward or vague. For example, the student writes \"a social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity\" without defining what they mean by \"social aspect\" or providing any context to explain why this is a significant trend.\nBased on these observations, I would award the student a score of 4/6. While the student has taken a clear position and provided some support for their argument, they could benefit from more detailed and specific examples, better organization, and clearer language. With further development and refinement, the student's response could be more persuasive and effective in convincing readers of their position.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's.

Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

The student identifies the setting as a key aspect of the essay and discusses how it impacts the cyclist's journey.\nFirstly, the student notes that the setting of the essay, which is a desolate desert road, creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability for the cyclist. The cyclist is exposed to the elements and lacks the support of other people or infrastructure in case of an emergency. This setting emphasizes the cyclist's reliance on their own resources and abilities, which is highlighted when the cyclist's water runs out and they must find a new source (support from the rubric: 1).\nSecondly, the student argues that the setting also creates a sense of danger and uncertainty for the cyclist. The road is rough and unpredictable, with obstacles such as tumbleweeds and a large snake appearing suddenly. This sense of danger and uncertainty adds to the cyclist's stress and discomfort, making it more difficult for them to focus and make decisions (support from the rubric: 2).\nFinally, the student suggests that the setting also affects the cyclist's mental state, causing them to feel hopeless and disillusioned. The cyclist's reliance on the old men's advice and subsequent disillusionment with their guidance adds to the sense of isolation and vulnerability, further complicating the cyclist's journey (support from the rubric: 3).\nThroughout their response, the student provides specific examples from the text to support their analysis, demonstrating a clear understanding of the essay's themes and techniques.

Saeng has just had a powerful experience of nostalgia and grief, but she is able to find solace in the familiarity of the hibiscus plant and her memories of her grandmother. This confidence in herself is evident in her determination to take the test again, and the student has accurately interpreted this as a sign of the girl's resilience and determination.\nSecondly, the student has highlighted the symbolism of the hibiscus plant in the story. The hibiscus is a symbol of Saeng's cultural identity and her connection to her grandmother, who taught her to appreciate the plant's beauty and fragrance. By ending the story with Saeng's vow to take the test again when the hibiscus is budding, the author is suggesting that Saeng's identity and connections to her past are not lost forever, but can be reignited and nurtured like the hibiscus plant. The student has accurately interpreted this symbolism and connected it to the girl's confidence in herself.\nFinally, the student has noted the intentionality of the author's ending. The author deliberately chooses to end the story in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, symbolizing Saeng's potential for growth and transformation. This is evident in the girl's vow to take the test again, which suggests that she is willing to confront her fears and challenges head-on, armed with the wisdom and confidence gained from her experiences. The student has accurately recognized the author's intentionality in ending the story in this way.\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the text and its themes, and has provided well-supported reasons for the author's choice of ending. The student's response is well-organized and clearly written, and they have earned a high score of 3.\nSCORE: 3/3",

However, there are some areas where the response could be improved.\nFirstly, the student correctly identifies the mood created by the author as one of satisfaction and love for Cuba, as well as relief. However, they do not provide specific examples from the memoir to support these claims. For example, they could have quoted the passage where Narciso mentions how much he enjoys the Cuban food and music, or where he expresses his gratitude towards his parents for their sacrifices. By providing specific examples, the student's answer would have been more convincing and well-supported.\nSecondly, the student mentions that the mood of the memoir is also one of family power and love. While this is a valid point, it could be further developed by providing specific examples of how Narciso's family demonstrated this power and love. For instance, the student could have discussed how Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees into their home and celebrated their arrival to the United States, or how they instilled in Narciso the importance of family and friends.\nLastly, the student's answer could benefit from more detailed and nuanced language. For example, instead of simply stating that the mood is one of \"satisfaction,\" the student could have analyzed the specific emotions and feelings that Narciso conveys throughout the passage, such as his sense of gratitude, nostalgia, or hope.\nIn conclusion, while the student's answer demonstrates some understanding of the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez, it could be improved by providing more specific examples from the memoir and using more nuanced language.

The tragic accident of the Hindenburg on May 6, 1937, highlighted the risks involved.\n2. Wind patterns: The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, making it difficult for dirigibles to moor safely. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mast due to the wind.\n3. Existing law: Another practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.\nThe student's answer is mostly correct, and they have provided relevant information from the excerpt to support their points.

        "essay": "The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

For example, the student jumps from describing the waiting situation to the main character's happiness after the appointment without providing enough context.\nStyle (3/3): The student's command of language is adequate, but there are some grammatical errors that hinder the flow of the story. For example, the student uses the wrong form of the possessive pronoun \"their\" instead of \"their.\" Additionally, the student could have used more variety in sentence structure to make the story more engaging.\nConventions (2/3): The student's response shows some inconsistency in the use of conventions of Standard English.

        "marker": " Based on the student's response, I have evaluated their answer using the provided rubric. Here is my detailed assessment and grading of the student's work:\nIdeas (6/6): The student tells a clear and focused story about a time when they were patient, which is evident in their use of specific details and events. They provide a clear example of a situation where they had to wait for their grandmother to prepare, and how they demonstrated patience by waiting for her rather than becoming frustrated or impatient. The student also effectively uses language to support their purpose and audience, including effective word choice and sentence structure.\nOrganization (4/3): The student's story is logically sequenced and connected to the prompt, but could benefit from additional detail and connection to the topic of patience. The student jumps between different ideas and events without a clear linking structure, which makes it difficult to follow their train of thought.\nStyle (3/3): The student demonstrates a good command of language throughout their response, including effective word choice and varied sentence structure. Their use of language effectively supports their purpose and audience, and their writing is generally clear and coherent.\nConventions (3/3): The student demonstrates a consistent and appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
