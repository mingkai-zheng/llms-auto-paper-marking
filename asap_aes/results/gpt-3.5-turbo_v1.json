Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.\n\n\nReview:\n\nThis response falls into the Score Point 2 category. The student attempts to take a position on the effects of computers on people but offers very minimal support. The response lacks development and organization, making it difficult to understand. The language is also informal and lacks clarity.\n\nFirst, the student states that computers are good because you can talk to friends and family on them. However, they provide no elaboration or examples to support this point. Additionally, this point is too general and lacks specificity.\n\nNext, the student mentions that people need computers to look for a job. Again, there is no further explanation or evidence provided to support this claim. The statement is vague and lacks any specific details.\n\nLastly, the student asserts that some people spend too much time on computers instead of doing homework, and people need to stop. This point is rather confusing and lacks clarity. The connection between spending time on computers and doing homework is not well-established, and the student does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support their position.\n\nOverall, the response lacks coherence and organization. The ideas are presented in a fragmented manner, making it difficult to follow the student's argument. The writing style is informal and contains multiple grammatical errors. Furthermore, the response shows little awareness of the audience, as it does not provide a clear persuasive argument.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

The reason why I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people @MONTH1 have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like @CAPS2 you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like @CAPS2 you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time.

        "marker": "Response:\n\nDear @CAPS1,\n\nIn my opinion, I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers is that @CAPS2 we can find help on something when we need it. Computers provide access to information that can be helpful, such as looking up homework problems on Google or visiting websites like http.historywork.com. These resources can offer support and assistance, making learning easier and more efficient.\n\nAnother reason why I believe we should use computers is that they provide a way for us to stay in touch with others. Through platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, or Myspace, we can communicate with our friends and family, even when we are unable to meet in person. This can help maintain social connections, especially in situations where meeting face-to-face is not possible.\n\nLastly, computers are often necessary for important communication. For instance, if you have an important message to send, accessing a website can be the quickest and most efficient way to deliver your message. It allows for instant communication, reducing delays and ensuring time-sensitive information is received promptly.\n\nIn conclusion, computers offer numerous benefits to individuals and society. They provide easy access to information, enable communication across distances, and facilitate efficient and timely messaging. Embracing computers can help us navigate the modern world and make the most of technological advancements.\n\nSincerely,\n[Student's Name]\n\nRationale for the Score: \nBased on the provided rubric, I would assign this response a Score Point of 3. \n\nThis response takes a position and offers some support for it, but the details provided are minimal and lack specificity. The first reason given is that computers can provide help, but the examples given are too general and vague. The second reason focuses on using computers for communication, but the explanation provided lacks depth and fails to address the counterarguments mentioned in the prompt. The third reason is somewhat relevant, as it discusses the use of computers for important messages, but the language and organization of the response are inconsistent, making it difficult to follow.\n\nThe response shows some awareness of the audience, as it addresses the local newspaper and attempts to persuade readers, but the overall structure and coherence of the response could be improved.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",
        "marker": "Overall, the student's response demonstrates an understanding of the topic and does attempt to persuade the readers to agree with their opinion. However, the response lacks organization and development, and the support provided is minimal and often vague. The writing is also awkward and contains errors, making it difficult to read and understand at times. With these factors in mind, I would assign this response a score of 2 out of 6.\n\nThe response begins with a brief introduction stating the author's opinion that computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. While this introduces the main idea, it is not well-developed and lacks specific details. The response then mentions some positive effects such as connecting with friends and learning about faraway places and people, but again, the support is minimal and lacking in elaboration.\n\nThe next paragraph attempts to address the negative effects of computers. The response mentions the lack of exercise and how excessive computer use can cut people off from family and friends. However, again, the support provided is minimal and lacks specific details. The response then briefly suggests that spending limited time on the computer each day while also spending time outside with family and friends is a good balance, but does not elaborate further on how this would be beneficial.\n\nThe subsequent paragraphs provide some examples of personal experiences with computers, such as playing video games and using social media. However, these examples are not well-connected to the main argument and lack depth. The response mentions using the computer for research and writing, but does not explain how these activities are beneficial or support the argument being made. The mention of watching videos on the computer is also not well-justified as a positive impact, as it does not specifically address the effects on people.\n\nThe response concludes by restating the opinion that the positive impact of computers outweighs the negative impact and encourages readers to take advantage of the new technology. However, this conclusion does not effectively summarize the main points made throughout the response and lacks a strong closing statement.\n\nIn terms of organization, the response lacks clarity and coherence. The ideas are presented in a fragmented and disjointed manner, with little flow between paragraphs or sentences. It is difficult to follow the reasoning and structure of the response, which detracts from its persuasiveness.\n\nOverall, while the student attempts to state their opinion and provide some support for it, the response lacks development, organization, and clarity. The minimal and vague details, awkward writing, and lack of awareness of the audience are major weaknesses that affect the overall persuasiveness of the response.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer.

The response does not effectively address the prompt or provide persuasive arguments about the effects of computers on people. Instead, the response focuses on online shopping, social networking sites, and online streaming of sports games. However, the points made are not adequately developed or supported.\n\nThe response lacks specific and relevant details to support the claims made. The student mentions online shopping but fails to explain how it benefits society or individuals. Similarly, the discussion of social networking sites is limited to mentioning famous people and the popularity of chatting, without offering any analysis of the impact on people or society.\n\nThe lack of clarity and organization further hampers the response. The ideas are presented in a disjointed manner, with little transition between paragraphs or within sentences. The excessive use of abbreviations and lack of punctuation also make the response difficult to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, the response shows little awareness of the audience or the purpose of the letter. While the prompt asks for a persuasive letter to the local newspaper, the response reads more like a personal reflection or stream of consciousness.\n\nGiven these shortcomings, it is evident that the student's response falls within the \"Score Point 1\" range.

Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

The response takes a position that computers have a negative effect on society. \n\nThe response starts with an introduction where the student states their disagreement with the idea that computers are good for society. However, the introduction lacks clarity and coherence. It does not clearly state the student's opinion or provide any preview of the main reasons that will be discussed. The introduction also contains grammatical errors and lacks proper punctuation.\n\nIn the body paragraphs, the student presents four reasons why they believe computers have a negative effect on people: obesity, cramps, increasing sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. The reasons chosen are somewhat relevant to the topic but lack sufficient elaboration and support. The student provides minimal details and fails to provide evidence or examples to support their claims. The discussion of each reason is very brief and lacks depth. Additionally, some of the statements made by the student, such as the percentage of time that teens and parents experience sexual harassment in chat rooms, lack credibility and are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe organization of the response is weak. The student jumps from one reason to the next without clear transitions or logical flow. The response lacks a coherent structure that would help the reader follow the argument systematically. As a result, the response is confusing and difficult to follow.\n\nThe language used in the response is generally simple and lacks sophistication. There are multiple grammatical errors, such as missing punctuation and incorrect verb tenses. The writing style is choppy and fragmented, making it difficult to read and understand. There is also limited use of transitional language, which further contributes to the lack of coherence in the response.\n\nThe response shows some awareness of the audience as it is written as a letter to the local newspaper. However, the writer does not effectively tailor the argument to persuade the readers. The response lacks persuasive language and fails to address counterarguments or provide a strong conclusion that summarizes the main points.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, I would assign this response a score of 2 out of 6.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

        "essay": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

They accurately mention three main obstacles: safety concerns regarding the flammability of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, the shifting winds on top of the building, and the legal restrictions on airships flying too low over urban areas.\n\nThe student uses relevant and specific information from the excerpt to support their points. They mention that dirigibles filled with hydrogen were highly flammable, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. They also correctly note that the wind currents on top of the building would make it unsafe to moor a dirigible, and that the stress and load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the building's foundation. Lastly, they mention the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.\n\nThe response is well-organized and provides a clear and concise description of each obstacle faced by the builders. The student effectively uses information from the provided excerpt to support their answer.\n\nOverall, the student's response meets the criteria for a Score Point 4: The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

The student briefly mentions that their parents rushed outside upon hearing the importance of the news, but the story quickly ends without elaborating on how the student exhibited patience in this situation. Therefore, the ideas in the response are minimally developed.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the story is weak. The events and ideas are not clearly connected or logically sequenced. The story starts abruptly with the student's decision to ride their bike without training wheels and then jumps to their parents rushing outside. There is no smooth transition or flow between these events. Additionally, the story ends abruptly without any conclusion or resolution. The lack of clear organization makes it difficult for the reader to follow the progression of the story.\n\nStyle:\nThe student demonstrates limited use of language in their response. There is a lack of variety in word choice, and the sentences are short and simplistic. The writing lacks effective and compelling language to support the purpose of the story. The lack of style hinders the impact and engagement of the narrative.\n\nConventions:\nThe student demonstrates limited use of conventions of Standard English. There are several grammatical errors throughout the response, such as incorrect verb tenses and unclear pronoun references. Additionally, words that should be capitalized are not, and there is inconsistent punctuation. These errors hinder the clarity and coherence of the writing.\n\nSCORE: 6/15",

We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": "Evaluation:\n\nIdeas (Score: 4)\nThe student tells a story about a time when they were patient. The story is focused on the topic of patience and includes specific details about the situation. The student explains how they continued to help their little brother learn to play catch even though they were tired of explaining. However, the ideas could be more thoroughly developed with more specific and relevant details. The student could have described their brother's progress throughout the story to show the growth and development of patience.\n\nOrganization (Score: 2)\nThe organization of the story is somewhat logical. The events are sequenced in a chronological order, starting with the family preparing for a meal and ending with the student's brother finally catching the ball. However, there are some lapses in organization and clarity. For example, the transition between the family going inside for the meal and the student's brother wanting to try one more time is not clear. The story could benefit from smoother transitions and clearer connections between ideas and events.\n\nStyle (Score: 2)\nThe student demonstrates an adequate command of language. They use simple and clear sentences to convey their story. However, there is limited use of language variety, which hinders the support for the writer's purpose and audience. The student could benefit from the use of more descriptive language to make the story more engaging and compelling.\n\nConventions (Score: 2)\nThe student demonstrates an adequate use of conventions of Standard English. There are some errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation throughout the response. For example, there are errors in capitalization (\"hot dogs and hamburgers\", \"I'm gonna tell you\", \"Lets go inside\", \"I was really alod\") and punctuation (\"'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so\", \"I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried\"). While these errors do not hinder overall comprehension, they do detract from the quality of writing.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",
