        "marker": "The student response is an undeveloped reaction to the question. While it does take a stance that computers are beneficial, it offers very minimal support to this claim. The student mentions that computers are good because they allow communication with family and friends as well as a platform for job searching, but these points lack specific details or further explanation to convince the reader. Additionally, the suggestion for a solution to people spending more time on computers than needed is crudely introduced without any expansion or clear argumentation.\n\nThe response does not show any organizational effort, especially since it talks back and forth between positives and negatives of computer use without a clear distinction. The wording is awkward and can be disjointed for readers, especially in the second sentence where the student abruptly introduces the issue of job searching without context. It also ends abruptly without summing up the argument or making a concluding statement.\n\nFurthermore, there is not enough evidence to suggest that the student is aware of the audience. The language and style used are casual, and do not fit the requirements of a letter to a local newspaper.\n\nConsidering these points, this student response would fall under Score Point 1 of the rubric due to the lack of elaborate and persuasive argument, absence of organization, inappropriate style and tone, and the neglected aspects of a well-rounded response. \n\nSCORE: 1/6.",

The student does list some potential uses for computers, but these are vague and unelaborated. There is no mention of the potential negative effects of excessive computer use which is stated in the prompt, and thus provides no counter to those concerns. \n\nMoreover, the student's language use is awkward and the fluency is hampered by the repetition of placeholder terms, and by the overall lack of cohesion and coherence. There are no clear transitions between thoughts and ideas, and no conclusion summarizing the student's argument or restating their stance.\n\nThe student has made an attempt to take a position and provide some reasons to support it, although they are vague and minimally developed.

The student suggests that computers are good because they allow you to \"email your family or friends any time you want too,\" but doesn't expand on why this is of particular significance or benefit. Similarly, the argument that computers enable access to websites or apps is stated without explaining why this is particularly valuable.\n\nThe response also lacks clear organization. While there are attempts to structure thoughts with repeated phrasing (e.g., \"That @CAPS1 why...\"), these phrases are used inconsistently and often without logical progression. \n\nThe letter sporadically addresses the audience, stating points as fact without linking them to the needs or interests of the readers.

Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online.

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

For some parts, it remains unclear what the student is trying to express, making the response come off as awkward and a bit confusing. For instance, the section about shopping online presents fragmented ideas that are not fully developed or connected coherently. The argument of contacting friends in particular locations while initially stated effectively starts to lose clarity and precision the further the student elaborates.\n\nTransitional language is essentially absent, making the response seem disjointed.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

These reasons are reasonably well articulated and include their role in teaching hand-eye coordination, providing the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and facilitating online communication with family and friends.

Throughout the response, the student has shown good connectivity across points, establishing a logical progression. \n\nHowever, the student's presentation could be more sophisticated.

In terms of audience awareness, the student does address the reader directly, but the tone throughout is too casual.

That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",
        "marker": "The student response is clear, taking a position on the effects of computers on people. While the student does attempt to address both the positives and negatives associated with computer use, the main angle taken is that the net effect is more positive, citing reasons like the ability to connect with friends, learn about far-reaching destinations, and gain knowledge from a variety of sources - in particular the social and educational applications of the technology.\n\nHowever, while the student provides a fair number of reasons, many of them could use more detailed elaboration. For example, the student mentions how digital games can help with hand-eye coordination without deeply exploring how this positively impacts individuals, or how it genuinely profiting necessities this particular skill in real-life settings. The student's viewpoint could have also benefited from the inclusion of more factual evidence or additional concrete examples, leaving the reader with a more solid understanding of the argument.\n\nThe argument organization is acceptable, though it can be a tad rambling in sections and transitions between ideas could be smoother, which left a bit of room for improvement. The student's fluency is sufficient, although it could be tweaked to have a better flow and coherence in the letter. \n\nWhen it comes to audience awareness, the student does seem to consider it at some points, but more consistent application of audience awareness could boost the effectiveness of the arguments. More specifically, they could further engage the reader by including rhetorical questions, calls to action or connections with specific real-life situations more directly relevant to the newspaper's readership.\n\nIn total, the student's response fits comfortably in score point 4 as a somewhat developed response. The paper takes a position and provides adequate support, it's only missing elaboration depth and details specificity, as well as sophistication in both writing and transitioning from one point to another.\n\nSCORE: 4/6",

Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",

The reasons provided, such as obesity, tree cutting and the presence of sexual predators on the internet, are only gradually touched upon and lack proper elaboration. Furthermore, some arguments do not make any sense or seem to be disconnected from the main idea., like the mention of baseball players becoming millionaires or that using computers could get someone killed. \n\nThe organization of the text is poor and the transitions between ideas are hard to follow or nonexistent. The letter is filled with grammatical inaccuracies, typos, and incorrect punctuation, which makes it challenging to understand and also suggests a lack of fluency. There seems to be little awareness of the audience, as some statements might come off as offensive such as the statement that people are fat because they use computers.\n\nHowever, the letter does take a firm stance against the use of computers, which is its only redeeming feature. This aligns with the first element of 'Score Point 2', but it does not meet other elements under that category. Therefore, the essay matches most closely with 'Score Point 1' on the given rubric since it contains few and vague details, is fragmented and difficult to read and understand, and shows no awareness of the audience. \n\nSCORE: 1/6.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer.

They support this position with three concrete reasons: computers facilitate communication with distant family and friends, they are helpful in emergencies, and they assist in managing finances/bills. \n\nHowever, there are a number of issues with this essay that prevent it from earning a higher score. First and foremost, the essay is fraught with numerous spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors that detract from its comprehensibility. This includes missing spaces, the use of incorrect words (such as \"hills\" instead of \"bills\"), and sentences that are not grammatically sound or complete. This falls under element 3 in Score Point 1 (\"May be difficult to read and understand\") as well as element 4 in Score Point 2 (\"May show little awareness of audience\").\n\nThe essay also contains some filler content (such as \"@PERCENT1\", \"@CAPS1\", \"@PERCENT2\", \"@LOCATION1\", \"@PERCENT3\") that do not add to the narrative or arguments. \n\nWhile the essay has a clear structure with an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion, it lacks sophistication and nuance with clumsy transitions, thus not meeting the standards for \"satisfactory organization\" required for Score Point 4. \n\nThe essay does have a strong conclusion that reiterates the initial position and summarizes supporting arguments. However, the reasons provided are generally unelaborated and the details provided are incorrect or nonsensical, which fits under element 1 in Score Point 2 and does not meet the \"moderately well elaborated reasons\" standard in Score Point 5.\n\nOverall, the essay takes a clear position and provides reasons, but the poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation; lack of clarity; awkward transitions; and general failure to elaborate on details makes it hard to understand and undermines the persuasiveness of the arguments.\n\nSCORE: 2/6.",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",
        "marker": "The student's response is rather extended and covers the topic relatively thoroughly. The student clearly lays out their position, namely that computers have a positive effect on people and society, and offers numerous reasons to justify it, such as computers facilitating social interactions, providing real-time news updates, and being a reliable and quick source of information. These reasons are sufficiently detailed and are elaborated upon. For instance, when talking about social interactions, the student even mentions the types of websites and programs used.\n\nMoreover, the response shows reasonable organization with each reason being discussed in its own paragraph. However, the response's organization could have been stronger. At times, the transition from one point to another could have been smoother.\n\nIn terms of fluency, the response is rather readable but suffers from numerous spelling and grammar mistakes, which hurt its clarity. The student repeatedly misspells words or uses the wrong words, as in \"propostorous motion\" instead of \"preposterous notion\", \"reacall\" instead of \"recall,\" \"wont\" instead of \"want,\" to name just a few examples. These errors drift the fluency and overall comprehensibility of the response.\n\nWhile the student shows an adequate awareness of the audience by addressing them directly (\"the experts can say what they want\"), and attempting to persuade them to agree with the presented viewpoint, occasional language misuse hinders successful persuasion.\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response manages to take a clear stance and provides quite solid support with a mix of specific and general details. Though organization is present, it needs improvement for a fuller clarity. Lingual shortcomings and the overall roughness of the text often affect its readability, fluency, cohesion, and ultimately the persuasiveness of the argument.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

He/she further expands on cyber bullying, describing how it can not only hurt feelings, but damage a child's self-esteem.

Such errors should be minimized for a better score. \n\nIn conclusion, the student's response is somewhat developed and takes a position with adequate support. However, errors in spelling and grammar, and the need for stronger examples and transitions prevent it from scoring higher. \n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

The student employs a real-life example, a fictitious person named \"@PERSON1,\" which effectively draws the reader's empathy into their argument. \n\nIn addition, the student utilizes statistics to enhance the persuasiveness of their argument, which gives credibility to their point about the negative physical effects of excessive computer usage. \n\nThe overall structure of the student's response follows a strong logical progression.

The student has instilled pertinent transitioning phrases between their arguments, which aids in coherence and easy comprehension of the whole idea.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas that need more attention. For instance, the student could have acknowledged, even if briefly, some of the positive impacts of computer and technology usage, before offering rebuttals. This would provide a more balanced view and likely not unintentionally alienate readers who may see the benefits of technology. \n\nDetermining a score, the student's work falls into Score Point 5. It's surely a developed response with a clear position, reasonably persuasive support, mostly specific details, generally strong organization, and consistent audience awareness. However, it lacks the heightened audience awareness and the subtle articulation of contrasting views expected in a '6.'\n\nSCORE: 5/6.",

Additionally, the student mentions the arrival at a vivid, which may refer to the ghost town or the fork in the road, but the term is misused and consequently unclear.\n\nThe answer concludes with the cyclist \"cave to his troubles\", but this does not make clear how the setting impacts the cyclist, nor does it reflect the end of the cyclist's journey where he eventually finds water and resolves to stick to his map in the future. \n\nIn sum, the student's response recognizes the general impact of the setting on the cyclist, but does not elaborately or accurately provide textual evidence. Also, the student's use of language is somewhat unclear or incorrectly used in several instances.

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.",
        "marker": "The student provided a detailed response that covered all the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The response included several specific details from the text, directly addressing each concern. The student explained that safety was an issue due to dirigibles from outside the United States using highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. The response explained how weather, particularly wind, was another obstacle due to the constantly shifting air currents at the top of the Empire State Building. The explanation about strengthening the building\u2019s frame to withstand the stress from the dirigibles and wind, shows the student's understanding of the engineering challenges faced by the builders. Finally, the response adequately addressed the legal concern of airships flying too low over city areas. The information was accurate and supported by the excerpt.\n\nHowever, the student response could have been improved by mentioning the Hindenburg disaster, which underscored the safety concerns of hydrogen-filled dirigibles flying over populated areas and could have given more details from the text such as \"The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear\".

However, the student never specifies what kind of office the situation is taking place in and uses placeholders such as \"@CAPS1\" and \"@CAPS2\", which is confusing. The ideas are somewhat relevant to the topic of patience, although some of the details, such as the conversation between the characters, are not directly connected to the theme of patience. The ideas certainly could have been further developed, but the story does offer a basic plot that centers around being patient while waiting, thus showing a basic understanding of the theme. Score: 4/6.\n\nOrganization: The story is chronologically organized, with events occurring one after the other in a cohesive order. The writer positions the characters in a waiting room, has them interact with the office professional, and wraps up with a thank you and goodbyes.

They illuminate multiple examples of patience within their family, maintaining consistency, but the elaborations on these examples are cursory at best. This situates their response at a Score 4 under the Ideas category.\n\nIn terms of organization, the student mostly displays proper and effective sequencing of ideas, bouncing from one family member to the next. However, there is a lack of clarity in connections between some ideas, and certain redundancies could have been avoided. Thus, a Score 2 would be given to this criterion.\n\nWhen we look at style, there is evident lack of variety in word choice and sentence structure. The sentence structure is quite repetitive, with almost every sentence starting with \"My x has to be patient because...\" While the word choice is effective, it is repetitive and lacks compelling language or varied sentence structure. This makes it a Score 1.\n\nThe response shows ineffective use of conventions of Standard English for grammar: for example, lines like 'her co-workers or even the people there really get on her nerves' and 'Both me and my brother are patient because...' demonstrate incorrect usage. Moreover, the entry lacks necessary punctuation in various instances, and there are a few misspelled words, such as 'patent' instead of 'patient' and 'baits dects' (whose meaning is unclear in this context due to a lack of correct spelling).

        "essay": "We had been patient enough on the plane ride to @ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient checking in. now was time for a true test of patience. We sat down at a table in a restaurant of the hotel. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, then dissappered. We got our drinks and waited for our meal @NUM1 min, @NUM2 min. @NUM3, @NUM4, @NUM5 min. after an hour we called her over and asked for bread. Lo and behold, she brings bread! We ask her where is our food. She promises to bring it out right away. We wait until we\u0092ve been waiting for @NUM6 hours. We call the manager over to complain, and he brings out the food a minute later. After @NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food.",
        "marker": "Ideas: The student's response contains a well-written narrative focused on an occasion demanding patience. The story, centering on a long wait for a meal at a restaurant, is directly related to patience. The explicit details and rising tension build-up gradually demonstrate the passage of time, helping to underline the theme of patience. However, it's unclear how patient the storyteller was, given that they eventually called the manager to complain about the long wait. This gives the storyline a slight contradiction, justifying a score of 4.\n\nOrganization: Despite the slight contradiction, the progression of ideas and events is logical and leads to a clear conclusion. This makes the underlying concept of the story easily comprehensible. The story begins with setting the context (plane ride and checking in the hotel), leading to the main event (waiting for food in the restaurant), and ends with a fulfilling conclusion (receiving the food after a long wait). Hence, the score is 3.\n\nStyle: The usage of language is mostly clear, with adequately varied sentences and phrases such as \"true test of patience,\" \"Lo and behold,\" and \"after an hour.\" There are effective word choices that support the purpose of the story. However, improvement in compelling word choice could improve the overall storytelling. Thus, the score is 2.\n\nConventions: The student demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the conventions of Standard English. Small errors such as \"dissappered\" instead of \"disappeared\" and improper use of symbol like \u201c\u2012\u201d instead of apostrophe \u201c\u2019\u201d in \"we've\" are noticeable. The sentence beginning with \"Lo and behold\" is structurally incomplete, although the meaning is still relatively clear. However, the grammatical issues do not entirely distract from the overall readability of the text. Score: 2.\n\nSCORE: 11/15.",

        "marker": "The student's writing manages to maintain a coherent narrative about anticipation for his birthday, therefore being somewhat focused on the topic. However, specific details are scarce and sometimes very hard to understand without clear explanations. The usage of @CAPS and the narration itself is somewhat confusing and off context, hence making it hard to perceive the exact occurrence. The development of the story doesn't provide a clear notation about how being patient makes the situation better or more manageable, making it slightly out of point in the context of the prompt. Therefore, the Ideas score would be a 2. \n\nThe events are quite logically sequenced - a child is excited at his birthday, he tells his parents about it, they come outside to celebrate. Therefore, the organization and connections between ideas and events get a score of 2.\n\nThe student's language is at times confusing, with phrases such as \"@CAPS1 through the front door and I yelled \u0093@CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS7 quickly I have something to tell you.\" that makes the narration quite hard to follow. The use of '@CAPS' placeholders is highly confusing and they also misuse certain pronouns. The student didn't manage to use 'son' properly to refer themselves in third person, which it shouldn't be doing in first person. Sentences do not vary much in structure and the language used is essentially basic. The Style is still somewhat adequate despite these shortcomings, with a rating of 1.\n\nThere are numerous grammatical and punctuation errors, such as lack of punctuation marks (commas, periods) at the end of the sentences which makes reading the essay a bit difficult. The capitalization of the first word of sentences is inconsistent, and the use of quotation marks is incorrect too. Considering all this factors, the student seems to have limited command over English conventions and so, the Conventions score would be a 1.\n\nOverall score - 2(Ideas) + 2(Organization) + 1(Style) + 1(Conventions) = SCORE: 6/15.",

        "marker": "The student's story is related to the topic of patience, which earns them some points in the Ideas category. However, the development of the story is not clear as there are confusing and/or missing details which make it somewhat difficult to follow. The use of placeholders like \"@CAPS1\", \"@CAPS2\", etc., as well as phrases like \"this story @CAPS6 completely untrue\" detract from the overall development of the story. Hence, an Ideas score of 2 seems most appropriate.\n\nOrganizationally, the story followed a decent chronological sequence and had some logical connections between ideas and events, leading to a score of 2. \n\nThe style is affected heavily by the fragmented sentences and recurrent use of placeholders, in addition to the general lack of compelling language and sentence variety. This warrants a Style score of 1.\n\nIn terms of conventions, there are several issues. The student consistently spelled \"writing\" as \"wrighting\", and \"groceries\" as \"grocerys\" and \"grocres\". They also used the incorrect forms of \"your\" and \"it's\" throughout the story. There are also capitalization issues and punctuation errors. The inconsistent use of conventions of Standard English results in a Convention score of 1.\n\nScore: 6/15.",

        "marker": "The student\u2019s response narrates a clear story about their patience in waiting a long time for their food at a restaurant. The details of how long they waited and their rising hunger help develop the main point of them exercising patience. However, the context for the patience, a wait in a restaurant, is too small in scope to demonstrate a deep reflection on the trait of patience. Therefore, the Ideas aspect can be scored a 4 as the account is somewhat focused on the topic and is developed with a mix of specific and general details. \n\nThe narration of the story shows logical sequencing. The student mentions the order of their arrival and food order, then the wait, and finally the arrival of the food. Therefore, the Organization aspect can be scored a 3 as the organization and connection between events are both clear and logically sequenced.\n\nThe sentence structure and word choice in the student's response are relatively plain, although they are clear. However, without any compelling or effective language usage, this piece does not stand out. It reads as more of an account of an event and less of a crafted story. Therefore, the Style aspect can be scored a 1 as limited use of language, including lack of variety in word choice and sentences, may hinder support for the writer's purpose and audience.\n\nIn terms of Conventions, this piece is relatively clean. There's an occasional extra space and a unique use of the symbol \"\u0096,\" but other than these minor issues, the grammar, usage, capitalization, punctuation, and spelling are appropriate for the grade level. Therefore, the Conventions aspect can be scored a 2 as it demonstrates an adequate use of conventions of Standard English.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",

For instance, the student could describe their thoughts, feelings, or actions during the waiting period to better illustrate their patience.\n\nWith regards to organization, the student introduces their story with a scene-setter and describes the sequences appropriately. However, the transition between ideas and events could be smoother, as there were parts where the reader was required to make leaps, such as when the grandparents suddenly announced plans to stay overnight in a hotel.\n\nThe student's style is simple and clear but lacks variety in word choice and sentence structure.
