Some people spend too much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.\"\n\nStep 1: looking at the first criterion of the rubric, which is the level of detail and support provided, it is clear that the student's response lacks specific details and elaboration. The student only provides two reasons why computers are beneficial, without expanding on how they can help people. Therefore, this criterion would score a 1.\n\nStep 2: moving to the second criterion, which is organization, the response shows little to no evidence of organization. The student jumps from discussing the benefits of computers to the negative effect of spending too much time on them without connecting the ideas logically. Therefore, this criterion would also score a 1.\n\nStep 3: looking at the third criterion, which is the writing style and language use, the response is awkward and fragmented. The student's sentence structure is simple, and there are no transitions between ideas. This criterion would score a 2.\n\nStep 4: the last criterion is the awareness of the audience. The student does not address the reader directly or take into consideration the reader's perspective. The response does not show any awareness of the audience, therefore this criterion would score a 1.\n\nSCORE: 1/6\n\nRationale: The student's response is undeveloped and lacks detail, organization, and sophistication in language use. The response does not address the reader and does not provide any persuasive elements to convince the reader to agree with the student's opinion. Therefore, the score earned is 1, which falls under the category of an undeveloped response according to the rubric.",

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

Organization: The letter has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student explicitly states their position in the opening sentence and then goes on to provide three specific reasons to support their argument. The response is well-structured and easy to follow, with each reason presented in a separate paragraph. However, there is some awkwardness in the transitions between paragraphs, and the conclusion could be more concise and summarizing. Score: 3.\n2. Reasons and Support: The student provides three reasons to support their position, which is adequate for a letter to the editor. However, the reasons could be more nuanced and elaborated. For example, the first reason, \"computers help people know about what happens in other countries,\" could be expanded upon by discussing the benefits of global connectivity and the importance of staying informed about current events. Additionally, the student could have provided specific examples or data to support their claims. Score: 3.\n3. Clarity and Coherence: The letter is generally easy to read and understand, but there are some areas where the writing could be improved.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

The response provides minimal support for the student's claim. They mention online shopping, social networking, and webcam functionality, but there's no elaboration or specific examples. (Score Point 2)\n3. The organization of the response is lacking. The student jumps between different topics (online shopping, social networking, webcam) without connecting them coherently. There's no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. (Score Point 2)\n4. The writing style is awkward and fragmented, with short, simple sentences and little cohesion. There are some grammatical errors (e.g., \"you @MONTH1 believe its pointless\"), and the use of transitions is limited. (Score Point 2)\n5. The response does not demonstrate a strong awareness of the audience. There's no clear purpose or consideration of the reader's perspective. The student does not use persuasive language or rhetorical devices to engage the reader. (Score Point 2)\n6. The response does not use language that is sophisticated, varied, or precise. The vocabulary is basic, and there are some errors in spelling and capitalization. (Score Point 2)\n\nOverall, the student's response could benefit from more development in all areas. They should provide clearer reasons, examples, and transitions to support their position. Additionally, the response should be organized around a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, with an increased focus on the reader's perspective.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

The response is somewhat developed, with a clear position and some supporting details, but lacks depth and sophistication in its arguments.\n\nThe response begins by stating that computers are bad for society, and the writer provides four reasons for this position: obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. However, the response could benefit from more specific and detailed examples to support these claims. For instance, the writer could have provided statistics or personal anecdotes to illustrate the negative impact of computers on people's health and well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the organization of the response could be improved. The writer jumps between different topics (obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying) without a clear structure or transition. It would be more effective to focus on one or two main points and develop them thoroughly, rather than touching on multiple topics superficially.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from more varied sentence structures and transitional phrases to improve its fluency and readability. The writer primarily uses simple sentences, which can make the response feel choppy and disconnected.\n\nFinally, the response shows some awareness of the audience, with the writer addressing the reader directly and using rhetorical questions to engage the reader. However, the tone of the response could be more persuasive and less confrontational. The writer could have used more emotional appeals and rhetorical devices to make their argument more compelling.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would give the student's response a score of 3 out of 6.

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": " The student's response is somewhat persuasive and provides adequate support for their position. However, there are some areas that could be improved upon.\n\nFirstly, the introduction is weak and does not effectively grab the reader's attention. The student could have started with a more compelling opening sentence that sets the tone for the rest of the letter. Instead, the reader is presented with a vague statement that does not provide a clear direction for the rest of the letter.\n\nFurthermore, the organization of the letter is somewhat confusing. The student jumps between different ideas quickly, without effectively connecting them. For instance, the student discusses the negative effects of computer usage on exercise, nature appreciation, and socializing, but these points are not clearly linked to each other. It would have been more effective to focus on one or two main points and expand upon them in more detail.\n\nAdditionally, the student's language and tone are not consistently persuasive. While there are some convincing sentences, such as \"What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature?\", other sentences come across as confrontational or accusatory, like \"How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends?\" This tone may alienate some readers who might otherwise be convinced by the argument.\n\nLastly, the conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize the main points of the letter. The student could have ended with a stronger statement that reinforces their position and encourages the reader to take action.\n\nGiven these factors, I would score this response as follows:\n\n* Score Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates some awareness of the topic and provides a clear position. However, the support and details are limited, and the organization and language could be improved.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

Additionally, some of the transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be smoother, making the response feel more disjointed than it needs to be.\n\nFurthermore, some of the reasons provided for the benefits of computers are quite general, without specific details to support them. For instance, the writer states that computers provide people with the ability to learn about faraway places and people, but does not offer any examples or explanation of how this works. Similarly, the claim that online news is beneficial because it provides people with the latest stories and updated events could be elaborated upon further.\n\nOverall, the student's response scores 4 out of 6.

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise.

However, the response also demonstrates several areas that need improvement, including a lack of clear organization, inadequate elaboration, and minimal awareness of the target audience.\n\n1. The response does not have a clear introduction that sets up the topic and the writer's position. Instead, it jumps directly into the arguments without providing any context or background information.\n2. The first reason provided for the benefits of computers is the ability to learn about faraway places, but this point is not elaborated upon. The writer merely states that \"computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places,\" without providing any specific examples or explanations.\n3. The second reason given is the ability to communicate with people online, but again, this is not developed further. The writer simply states that \"Computers allow people to talk online with other people,\" without discussing the specific benefits of this feature or how it can positively impact society.\n4. The response lacks a clear structure and transitions between ideas. The writer jumps from discussing the benefits of computers for learning and communication to the idea that computers can make exercising and nature walks easier, without connecting these ideas logically.\n5. The writing is often awkward and fragmented, with short, disconnected sentences that make it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. For example, \"Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks, they make @CAPS6 easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well.\"\n6. The response does not demonstrate a strong awareness of the target audience. The writer does not address the reader directly or engage with the reader's perspective.

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",

Firstly, the introduction could be stronger. The student could have started with a hook that grabs the reader's attention or provided a brief overview of the issue before stating their position. Secondly, some of the sentences could be clearer and more concise. For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph is quite long and could be broken up into two simpler sentences. Thirdly, the student could have used more specific examples to support their arguments.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

The response is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student provides several specific examples and statistics to support their argument, and also acknowledges potential counterarguments.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, the introduction could be stronger. Instead of simply stating that computers are \"ruining lives,\" the student could provide a more nuanced explanation of their position and why they believe it is important to address this issue. Additionally, some of the sentences could be clearer and more concise. For example, the sentence \"The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers\" could be rephrased as \"Computers contribute significantly to the growing obesity epidemic among children.\"\n\nFurthermore, some of the statistics and examples provided by the student are not entirely relevant to their argument. For instance, the fact that children spend more time on computers than exercising does not necessarily prove that computers are the sole cause of obesity. The student could have focused more on the negative effects of excessive screen time and the potential for computers to contribute to a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nIn terms of organization, the response is generally well-structured, but there are some transitional issues. The student jumps abruptly from discussing cyberbullying to the impact of computers on physical health, without much connection between the two points. Additionally, the conclusion could be more concise and impactful. Instead of repeating the main points of the essay, the student could have ended with a stronger call to action or a more thought-provoking statement.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt and provide supporting evidence.

However, the response does not use implied information from the text or consider alternative interpretations of the setting's features.\n3.

The student also mentions the return of the geese and how it signifies the time Saeng needs to wait before taking the test again.

However, the student's explanation for why the author chooses to end the story in this way could be more detailed and nuanced. The student states that the spring season will bring warmer weather and more fun, which may be true, but it doesn't adequately explain why the author chose to emphasize the return of the geese as a symbol of Saeng's renewed determination to pass the test.\n\nFurthermore, the student's response could benefit from more specific examples and details from the text to support their claims.

Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even \"swivel around the mooring mast.\" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to evaluate the student's response using the provided rubric.\n\nFirst, let's look at the ideas presented in the story:\n\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide a clear example of a time when they were patient. They describe the scenario in detail, including their excitement to ride their bike without training wheels and their efforts to get their mother's attention. However, the story is a bit simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not provide any insight into their thoughts or feelings during the situation, nor do they explain why this experience was important to them. Therefore, I would score this aspect of the response as a 4, as the ideas are somewhat focused on the topic but could be more thoroughly developed.\n\nNext, let's examine the organization of the story:\n\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be smoother, and some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the story. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the scene. Therefore, I would score the organization aspect of the response as a 2, as it is logically sequenced but could benefit from more attention to detail.\n\nNow, let's look at the student's use of language:\n\nThe student's language is adequate, but there are some areas that could be improved. For example, the student uses repetitive language, such as \"it is\" and \"my,\" and could benefit from more varied sentence structures. Additionally, some of the sentences feel a bit awkward or unnatural, which may detract from the overall effectiveness of the story. However, the student does use some descriptive language, such as \"gorgeous day\" and \"best part,\" which helps to paint a picture in the reader's mind. Therefore, I would score the language aspect of the response as a 2, as it is adequate but could be improved with more attention to detail.\n\nFinally, let's examine the conventions used in the story:\n\nThe student's use of conventions is somewhat inconsistent. For example, they inconsistently capitalize the names of family members and forget to capitalize the first word of a sentence. Additionally, there are some minor spelling errors, such as \"(@CAPS2\" instead of \"Mum.\" However, the student does use appropriate punctuation throughout the story. Therefore, I would score the conventions aspect of the response as a 2, as there are some errors but also some correct uses of conventions.\n\nOverall, I would give this response a score of 12/15. While the student provides a clear example of a time when they were patient, their story could benefit from more depth and detail. Additionally, the student could improve their use of language and conventions to make their story more effective and polished.\n\nSCORE: 12/15",

Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my detailed evaluation of the student's response:\n\nIdeas (Score 4/6):\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide several specific details that demonstrate their understanding of the concept. They describe a situation where they had to be patient with their younger brother who was struggling to catch a football. The student also explains how they felt frustrated but decided to continue helping their brother until he finally caught the ball. However, the story could benefit from more depth and complexity. For example, the student could have explored the emotions they felt during the process or reflected on the impact that patience had on their relationship with their brother.\n\nOrganization (Score 3/3):\nThe student's organization is clear and logically sequenced. They begin by describing the setting and the activity, then transition to the main event of teaching their brother how to catch a football. The student also uses transitional phrases, such as \"After he caught it,\" to connect their ideas. However, the story could benefit from more attention to sentence-level connections and transitions.\n\nStyle (Score 2/3):\nThe student's language use is generally effective, but could benefit from more variety in sentence structure and word choice. For example, the student repeatedly uses the phrase \"I said\" to begin sentences, which could be varied to create more interest and flow. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to paint a clearer picture of the scene. However, the student does use some descriptive language, such as \"bright sunny day\" and \"all of us knew how to throw and catch a football,\" which adds some depth to the story.\n\nConventions (Score 3/3):\nThe student's response demonstrates a consistent and appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. There are no major errors that detract from the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\nSCORE: 12/15\n\nRationale:\nThe student's response demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt and provide specific details that support their understanding of patience. However, the response could benefit from more depth and complexity in terms of ideas and organization. Additionally, the student could improve their language use by varying sentence structure and word choice to create more interest and flow. Nevertheless, the student demonstrates a good understanding of conventions and grammar, which contributes to the overall effectiveness of the response.",
