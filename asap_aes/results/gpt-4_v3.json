        "marker": "The student's response is rather underdeveloped. They take a simplistic two-fold position - that computers are beneficial for job searches and staying connected with friends, but also people should refrain from spending excessive time on them. The positions are not backed by more specific details or comprehensive elaboration thereby making the argument weak and somewhat confusing. For instance, the student could have explained more about the impact of excessive computer usage on physical health, mental wellbeing or academic performance. The arguments lack coherent transitions and it's slightly unclear if the student is entirely for or against computer usage. \n\nBased on the rubric, the response fits some criteria of both Score Points 1 and 2. Although the student provides some reasons, these do lack elaboration and depth. And while some position on the issue is taken, the overall response remains fragmentary and simplistic with a very limited awareness of the audience.\n\nOn a technical note, the response contains language errors and lacks the formal approach necessary for a letter to a newspaper. The student does not introduce their letter properly, and the punctuation and sentence structure could be improved.\n\nAs such, it would be fair to assign the response a Score Point of 1, as it lacks key elements of Score Point 2, especially the coherent organization of thoughts and overall fluidity.\n\nSCORE: 1/6",

Given the lack of clarity in points made, it's unclear if the positions taken are adequately supported. \n\nIn terms of the rubric, the letter indeed lacks specific details (point 1), and while it seems to suggest several uses for computers, these are more difficult to interpret due to repeated placeholders. Using placeholders without making clear what they represent causes the response to feel awkward and fragmented (point 2). \n\nThe understandability of the response is seriously compromised (point 3), and it's uncertain whether or not the student properly recognizes their audience as readers of a local newspaper (point 4) because we cannot infer the intended meaning with so many unspecified placeholders.\n\nTherefore, despite the effort to provide several reasons for the use of computers, the student's response fits a Score Point 1 as it fails to present clear arguments and the usage of placeholders instead of concrete examples or reasons make the response very hard to understand. \n\nSCORE: 1/6",

However, the text in its current state is rather hard to follow depending on the context (@CAPS, @ORGANIZATION2). This communicates a lack of competence in language use and the mechanics of writing to a wider audience.\n\nThe letter does contain some reasons and examples to back up the student's position, like the idea that you can connect with people faster and easier, and that computers are used widely for office work. However, the details provided are quite general and unelaborated. The student refers to computers as being able to be used to go to \"everything\" like @ORGANIZATION2 and \"@CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4\". The use of '@' placeholders and lack of specific information makes the message unclear.\n\nThe organization of the letter is also weak. Ideas are strung together with limited connection or transitional language. This makes the progression of thoughts hard to follow. The letter also repeatedly states that computers are beneficial and that they make things easier without really providing persuasive arguments to back up these claims.\n\nIt's clear that the student is writing to an audience as they use phrases like \"In my opinion\" and \"I believe\". However, the language used and the text's structure suggest that the student understands the expectation to write to an audience more than they actually exhibit a deep understanding of how to adjust their writing to suit an audience.\n\nBased on this, the student\u2019s response falls within the 2 score range as per the rubric. While the response does take a position, it contains only general reasons with unelaborated and list-like details and shows little evidence of organization. Additionally, the language used may be somewhat simplistic and may show very little awareness of audience. \n\nSCORE: 2/6.",

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world.

Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

For instance, talking about emailing or shopping online isn't tied directly to experience or concrete examples. \n\nThere is an attempt at organization, showing some chronological thoughts about how computers are beneficial.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "marker": "The student's response clearly takes a position on the effects of computers on people and supports this position with reasons and examples. This is aligned with the highest points on the rubric (score 5 and 6). \n\nThe student's reasons include cogent points about the benefits of hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places and people, and connecting with family and friends online. These points are somewhat elaborated upon, such as in the explanation of how online games can improve reflexes and eyesight, and how using the computer can simulate the experience of being in faraway places. These reflect a moderate level of detail, putting it in between score point 4 and 5 on the rubric. However, they could be more specific and well-explained to meet the \"fully elaborated reasons with specific details\" required for a score point 6.\n\nThe response exhibits a generally strong organization with an introduction, different points elaborated in different paragraphs, and a conclusion. This also aligns with score point 5. \n\nThe response is somewhat fluent and uses transitional phrases, such as \"first,\" \"another thing,\" \"finally,\" and \"in conclusion.\" However, these transitions are not sophisticated and could be better integrated to improve the flow. This demands a score point between 4 and 5.\n\nRegarding the awareness of the audience, the student does show some understanding of the audience (the readership of a local newspaper) by direct addressing and the persuasive tone. However, this could be more naturally and compellingly expressed to meet the \"heightened awareness of audience\" required for a score point 6.\n\nConsidering the rubric and the analysis above, the student's response fits most closely to a score of 5.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

However, these reasons are neither thoroughly explained nor supported by specific details, making them seem unelaborated and list-like. Organization seems to be lacking as the points appear to be randomly placed without any logical flow. \n\nThe response fares a bit better under Score Point 3 criteria, in that the student does take a position and shows some awareness of the audience by writing with an encouraging tone purposed to convince.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

A number of specific details, such as the usage of social media to connect with friends and family or how they use it to unwind after a long day, amplify the student's argument. \n\nThe letter exhibits satisfactory organization. This is evident as the student starts by identifying their viewpoint, moves on to provide their reasons along with examples, and concludes by summarizing the advantages of computers and reintroducing the pre-established argument. Regarding fluency, the student provided some transitions to merge ideas and maintain the flow of argument.\n\nThe student shows an understanding of their audience, as they are writing to the editor of a local newspaper. The language used is simple and accessible, and is thus appropriate for the targeted audience.\n\nHowever, the student's use of language somewhat impacts the overall fluoency, as there are a handful of spelling errors (e.g. \"extrodinary\", \"twill\", \"outlit\") and words are used incorrectly in some places (e.g. \"@PERSON1\"). There are also instances where sentences lack adequate clarity, for instance, \"The computer lets me see nature\", making it hard to understand the student's context.\n\nIt is also noticed that the student mentioned negative aspects of computer usage but quickly dismissed them without providing a counterargument. Showing an understanding of counterarguments and refuting them effectively could strengthen the student's stance further. \n\nTherefore, based on the rubric provided, the student's response seems to be a good fit for Score Point 4. This score point describes a somewhat-developed response that takes a position and provides adequate support with a satisfactory organization and adequate awareness of audience. \n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "The student\u2019s letter is somewhat developed and presents a clear opinion against computer usage. The student successfully states their position and provides reasons supporting their opinion. These reasons include obesity, cramps, and increase in activities like sexual harassment, and cyberbullying due to computers. \n\nThough the reasons to support their argument are varied and specific, they are not well elaborated. For instance, the connection between computer usage and obesity is discussed assuming the user is a child who has no other activities but computer usage, which is not realistic or fully developed argument. Similarly, the argument around cramps lacks adequate explanation. The points about sexual harassment and cyberbullying have been elaborated substantially more, but still lack specifics and depth needed for a thorough argument. \n\nThe letter shows some organization with each paragraph discussing a different point, but lacks transitional language making the arguments seem disjointed. More appropriate transitions and connectors between ideas could strengthen the structure of the letter. \n\nThe student shows some awareness of audience, using words like 'you', indicating they're addressing the reader. However, their language and tone are more informal than what would be expected in a letter to a local newspaper and the use of phrases such as 'tip-top-tip-top' and '@CAPS1' shows a lack of awareness of the form of communication. \n\nIn terms of grammar and spelling, the student\u2019s work contains numerous errors, which detracts from the overall quality and readability of the letter.\n\nReflectively, the student\u2019s work falls between score points 3 and 4, leaning more towards score point 3, due to the limitations in the development of the argument, organization, and command over language and form of communication. \n\nSCORE: 3/6",

        "essay": "Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",
        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position in favor of the use of computers, arguing that they enable communication between individuals who are geographically separated, can aid in emergencies, and assist in managing finances and bills. However, the quality of the support and argument provided to uphold this position is mixed, limiting the overall effectiveness of the student's response.\n\nIn terms of the content and details provided to support their stance, the student predominantly offers broad reasons, which are then elaborated on minimally. For instance, they note that computers are a crucial communication tool, particularly for those with family members living in different states, but the details provided to justify this claim are vague and somewhat difficult to comprehend. This pattern is repeated across the course of their response, impeding the overall persuasiveness of their argument. Therefore, the first criterion of the rubric would suggest that the student's response aligns most closely with Score Point 2 or 3.\n\nThe student's response exhibits some attempt at organization. They present their arguments sequentially, signaling the transition from one point to another with introductory phrases (\"First...\", \"secondly...\", \"Thirdly...\", \"In conclusion...\"). However, the sequence and flow of ideas within each paragraph can be quite jumbled and confusing, which reduces the clarity of the presented information. This results in the student's response aligning more with Score Point 2 according to the second criterion of the rubric.\n\nThe student's writing is also somewhat awkward and confused in parts, possibly due to errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure. Additionally, the student occasionally employs repetitive phrasing and shows no sophisticated use of transitional language. This limits the fluency and coherence of their argument, resulting in their response falling into Score Point 2 in the third rubric criterion.\n\nFinally, the student does demonstrate an awareness of their intended audience - readers of a local newspaper - by directly addressing them in this letter and attempting to persuade them using emotive language and examples. However, this awareness is not consistently evident, resulting in the response aligning most closely with Score Point 3 according to the fourth criterion of the rubric.\n\nIn conclusion, while the student has taken a strong position and attempted to persuade the reader of their viewpoint, issues with their detail provision, the organization of their ideas, the fluency of their argument, and a consistent awareness of their audience limit the overall quality of their argument. The student's response would benefit from clearer and more detailed elaboration of their reasons, better organization of their ideas, improvements in writing fluency, and a heightened awareness of their audience.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states \"@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts.\" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future. People say kids are the future, not if theyre not succesfull. Computers are a great way for kids of all ages to learn & communicate with @NUM1 another & others.

As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me.",
        "marker": "The student's answer does show an attempt to persuade the reader on the benefits of computer use, particularly targeting children and their need for such skills in the future. There are reasons provided for their standpoint that includes personal anecdotes of the writer's sister and cousins, and their positive experiences with computers. The student also presents a counter-argument acknowledging risks of internet use for children like exposure to unsuitable content and the risk of obesity due to inactivity, and then counters these with parental controls and time limits. \n\nHowever, the elaboration of the reasons is somewhat weak and unspecific. For instance, the claim that all children should have computers is not backed up with solid arguments other than an assumption that it will make them successful. The hypothetical testimonies of \"Expert @PERSON1\" and \"Kid therapist @PERSON2\" are relatively weak due to the lack of exact details and context. Therefore, while the student does provide reasons and examples, the lack of depth and detail in their explanations renders them less persuasive and credible.\n\nMoreover, the letter is organized but the flow between arguments and points could be much smoother. The student's letter shows some awkwardness particularly in the use of language and the excessive use of ampersands (&) in place of 'and'. While the message may be understood, the delivery is not fluent or sophisticated. \n\nThe student does show some awareness of the audience as the letter appeals to parents and utilizes a conversational tone. However, the excessive casual comments such as \"trust me\" and \"heed my advice\" may detract from the persuasiveness and professionalism of the appeal. \n\nConsidering these points, the student's letter falls into the category of a somewhat-developed response that takes a position and provides adequate, though not convincingly elaborated, support. The response is marked by satisfactory organization, somewhat fluent language, and adequate awareness of the audience. \n\nHowever, the persuasiveness is significantly marred by the lack of fluency and awkward writing style.\n\nSCORE: 4/6",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

This makes the response less robust, limiting the score they can receive. \n\nThe student's response shows an adequate organization, following a format where they first established their position and then elaborated on their reasons one by one. But the response lacks fluency, with some awkward sentence constructs and limited usage of transitional language and phrases.

Their response takes a position and provides adequate support, showing satisfactory organization. They show adequate awareness of the audience but lack fluency and transitional language. However, the response needs to include a variety of robust reasons, improve sentence construction, increase usage of transitional language, and correct spelling mistakes to qualify for a higher score.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

The usage of a direct personal account from a victim of cyberbullying effectively drives home their point. Furthermore, it introduces a strong emotional appeal into their argument. The discussion of obesity related to computer usage is supported by statistical data, another robust form of evidence, thus satisfying the second criterion of the rubric for a high score.\n\nThe organization of the letter is strong.

The response takes a clear position and provides support that is persuasive and mostly specific. It is generally well-organized and reveals some awareness of the audience. The usage of transitional language could be improved to add to the overall fluency of the piece.\n\nSCORE: 5/6",

Addressing the question: The question specifically asked how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. While the student does mention the influence of the old men's advice, they fail to mention the significant elements regarding the setting: the high Californian desert, a deserted ghost town, a faulty water pump, intense sun, and dehydration that drastically affected the cyclist's journey.\n\n3. Use of information from the text: The student's response includes only basic information directly gleaned from the text, but it is not sufficient to indicate a comprehensive understanding of the text in relation to the question. They needed to use more detailed examples from the story to support their explanation fully.\n\n4. Connection to a conclusion or assertion: The response is light on the connection between the old men's advice and the cyclist's subsequent dire situation. The student failed to extract the ironic and significant details from the text that led to the cyclist's trials, which made the response feel undeveloped and lack a solid conclusion.\n\nConsidering all the above factors, the student's response seems to fit into the score 1 category best, as it only provides evidence of a minimal understanding of the text and lacks specific information to support the cyclist's ordeal in relation to the question.\n\nSCORE: 1/3",

The student makes general references to the cyclist's struggle with dehydration and his navigation of a rough and challenging road. These superficial touchpoints show evidence, albeit somewhat cryptic, of deriving meaning from the text, thereby fulfilling aspect 1 of the score 1 rubric. Nevertheless, the student's nod towards the 'plane' and its potential as a symbol of change or a new course suggests some misunderstanding, marking element 2 of the score 1 criteria. \n\nAdditionally, the student's sentence structure, spelling, and grammar errors impede the clarity and coherence of their argument. The student, for instance, refers to the rough and rugged path as a \"rusty-bumpy road,\" providing some implied reasoning of the difficult terrain based on the direct text, but his choice of phrasing - 'rusty' in particular - fails to correctly capture the characteristics of the journey or the settings' features as detailed in the text. This somewhat fulfils the first aspect of the score 2 rubric, but the response overall lacks precision and nuance of understanding. \n\nMoreover, the student does not provide a substantial connection between the textual evidence and a broader conclusion about the text, which departs from the second aspect of the score 2 and 3 criteria. The reference to the 'plane' as a space where the cyclist might find change obscures rather than enlightens the argument, revealing a misunderstanding of the text and the question. \n\nThe student's response, in conclusion, demonstrates a minimal understanding of the text, reflecting the criteria for a score 1. Though the student acknowledges the hardships on the cyclist and hints towards the notion of change, the inaccuracies in comprehension and faulty interpretation limit the response's depth and accuracy. \n\nSCORE: 1/3.",

Thus, the student meets the second criterion of Score 2, as they are using expressed information from the text to demonstrate understanding.\n\nNonetheless, the response lacks in two other aspects. Firstly, it does not fully address the demands of the question. While it correctly retells the events, the student does not explicitly explain how these features of the setting affected the cyclist, which was the crux of the question. For instance, in retelling the event where the cyclist faced hills, it would be more appropriate to connect this to how it affected the cyclist, for instance, how it made the trip more physically challenging and depleted his water faster, hence exacerbating his dehydration. The same goes for the rest of the features of the setting that they listed.\n\nSecondly, the response does not fully connect the support to a conclusion about the text. While the student provides a fair amount of supporting details from the text, they fail to effectively conclude how these features of the setting affected the cyclist. One helpful concluding statement could be that the remote, harsh and changing terrains exacerbated his physical challenges, led to dangerous encounters, and increased his struggles due to isolation and scarcity of resources.\n\nConsidering all these points, the student\u2019s response fits more appropriately in Score 2 on the grading scale, indicating a partial understanding of the text.\n\nSCORE: 2/3",

While the student discusses how the cyclist was affected, they didn't specify how exactly the setting's features played into that effect outside of the cyclist's isolation. They only mention the environment vaguely and focus more on the actions of the cyclist. \n\n2. The answer uses expressed information from the text to demonstrate understanding, such as the derelict juice factory and the cyclist's prediction of his death. The student also indicates their understanding of the cyclist's frustration with the old men's advice, which is implied throughout the text. However, the student fails to fully explain the cyclist's gradual loss of hope and struggle in relation to the hardships he faced due to the setting.\n\n3. The connection between the support provided by the student and the conclusion is not entirely explicit. The setting's features are more associated with specific events rather than their impact on the cyclist. The conclusion doesn't tie these parts together to showcase a meaningful understanding of the text beyond its literal interpretation.\n\nGiven these points, the student's response partially but does not fully address the question asked. Though the student provides examples from the text and makes some connections between those examples, they do not completely develop the way the setting's features affected the cyclist.

It also doesn't provide enough pointed, specific information from the memoir. The connection it does establish between the memoir and the described mood is broad and lacks specificity. The response also includes some misinterpretations.\n\nTherefore, this answer does not meet the criteria for a score point of 4, 3, or even 2. It is a minimal description of the mood created by the author and includes some misinterpretations and lacks clear and specific support from the memoir. As such, it aligns best with a score point of 1.\n\nSCORE: 1/4",

This first issue outlined in the student response is the fact that a dirigible moored at the top of the building would add a significant amount of pressure and stress that the building's frame would have to support. This was a clear obstacle as it would require major modification of the building's frame to accommodate the load, which in turn would require alterations to be made to the building's foundation.\n\nThe second issue outlined in the student response is that the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose, given that the issues that would arise should have been apparent before it was constructed. The student does not go on, however, to further detail or explain what these issues specifically are as described in the text. \n\nAlthough the student touches on two key difficulties that were faced, they do not go into much depth or detail and there are other issues that were importantly mentioned in the text that the student failed to mention in the response such as the safety issues associated with docking dirigibles filled with hydrogen, the constant shifting winds at the top of the building, and the laws against airships flying too low over urban areas, all which proved prohibitive for the concept of docking dirigibles at the high altitude of the Empire State Building.\n\nTherefore, the student's response shows an understanding that there were complications, and includes some specific information.

As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even \"swivel around the mooring mast.\" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, \"This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...\" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose.",

For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down.

One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a \"populated area like downtown new york\". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york.

The student mentions the structural issues with the building accommodating a thousand-foot dirigible, the use of flammable hydrogen in dirigibles and the arising safety concerns, and the problem with the shifting winds affecting the mooring mast and dirigible.\n\nWhile these are all valid points drawn from the text, the explanation is not complete. The student failed to mention the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which was presented as another obstacle in the text. Furthermore, the student's language and wording are a bit unclear and could be improved for better comprehension. This can be seen in the statement, \"the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york,\" which is difficult to understand.\n\nLooking at the rubric, this answer aligns best with three points, which denotes a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description, including relevant but often general information from the excerpt. However, due to the language clarity issue and incomplete information, it might lean more towards a two-point response.\n\nRationale:\n\nFor clearer language usage and completeness in covering all the points from the text, deducting a point seems reasonable. For the incomplete description of obstacles, another half point should be deducted. Yet, considering that the student made some valid points drawn directly from the text, the student still demonstrates partial description and uses limited, but relevant, information from the excerpt. \n\nScore: 2.5/4.",

The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened.

She said it was a bit pricy, but that she would get it. The next week was very long, waiting for the shirt. On @DATE1 it came, pale yellow, red, blue, and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear to games and make great saves.",
        "marker": "Ideas: The student tells a short story about a time when they had to be patient and wait for their football jersey. They have moderately focused on the theme of patience and developed this idea with specific details, such as the color of the jersey and the wait time. However, the story lacks depth in the exploration of patience as a concept. More details or more focus on feelings during the wait duration could have strengthened this aspect. Therefore, the ideas score is 4.\n\nOrganization: The ideas are clear and logically sequenced. From seeing the jersey in a store catalog to asking the mom for it, waiting, and finally receiving it - the sequence of events are coherent and to the point. The organization however lacks complexity since the story told is quite simple. A score of 2 seems appropriate here. \n\nStyle: The language command is adequate with clear sentences. The words are effectively chosen considering the context of the story. But there's a lack of effective and compelling word choice and varied sentence structure. This receives a score of 2.\n\nConventions: From a conventions perspective, the student demonstrates an adequate use of the norms of Standard English for grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation appropriate for their grade level. There doesn't appear to be any significant errors. Therefore, the conventions score is 2.\n\nIn summation, the student tells a simple, clear story about an experience related to patience. The story, while lacking in-depth exploration of patience as a concept, maintains a logical sequence of events and an adequate command of language. Conventions are adequately used. \n\nSCORE: 10/15.",

        "marker": "Ideas: The student\u2019s response meets the requirement of the question and tells a story about a time when the student was patient. However, the story is not thoroughly developed; it lacks specific, relevant details to fully illustrate the situation and the feeling of being patient. For example, the student could have described in more detail how they spent their time waiting or what thoughts they were grappling with. Therefore, the score in this category is 4.\n\nOrganization: The student's story follows a logical sequence with clear transitions between the ideas. The story starts from arriving at the hospital, waiting patiently, struggling internally, and culminates with the moment of joy when they finally get to go in. Therefore, the organization of the story earns a 3.\n\nStyle: The student\u2019s command of language is somewhat limited. While the language used is clear and straightforward, there is a lack of variety in word choice and sentence structures. The use of phrases like \"I couldn't take it no more\" and \"I was the happiest man on earth\" can be viewed as attempts to express feelings and emotions. However, more sophisticated and varied language could have delivered a vivid and profound expression of the student\u2019s thoughts and feelings about being patient. Therefore, the score in this category is 1.\n\nConventions: There are several issues with the use of Standard English conventions in the student's response. These include inappropriate use of @CAPS1 and ??, failure to use apostrophes in \"couldnt\" and \"I wasnt\", and incorrect verb form in \"every ?? went in for the appointments\".

        "marker": "The student's response primarily focuses on the story of waiting in line for a water roller coaster, with the patience aspect a bit more subtle. Nevertheless, the idea of the long wait does tie into the theme of patience. Specific details to describe the scene and the student's activities while waiting are included. Therefore, in the Ideas category, the student scores a 4. \n\nOrganization-wise, the response can become confusing because it is one long run-on sentence with minimal punctuation and lack of necessary transition words. Although the sequence of events is clear, there is a fair amount of disconnection between the different sections. Thus, the student gets a score of 1 for the Organization category.\n\nFor Style, the student's language use is rather basic and repetitive. Little variety is seen in sentence structure, and word choice remains fairly simple throughout. Thus, the student receives a score of 1 in the Style category.\n\nConcerning Conventions, the student performs poorly. There are several instances of improper grammar, misspellings, and incorrect punctuation. Several phrases are difficult to understand due to these issues. The student earns a score of 1 in the Conventions category.\n\nIn conclusion, the student\u2019s response shows a decent understanding of the topic of patience, but considerable improvement is needed in terms of organization, style, and conventions of Standard English. \n\nSCORE: 7/15.",

        "marker": "The student tells a specific story about having to be patient while waiting in line for a roller coaster ride, which clearly relates to the task's issue of patience. The main point is developed adequately, though more could be said about the feelings they encountered while waiting, beyond the mere acknowledgment that they had to wait. This would constitute a score of 4/6 for Ideas.\n\nThe story's organization is clear, with an introduction setting up the situation, a middle section describing the wait and the payoff (the roller coasters), and a conclusion reflecting on the experience and the value of patience. Thus, a score of 3/3 for Organization is warranted.\n\nIn terms of style, the student seems to struggle a bit. The language and sentence structure are relatively simplistic and repetitive, and there are a few spelling and grammar errors. While the student's voice is clear, and there are some attempts at creative language use (\"Yay! Yag!\"), the command of language could be improved. This would be a 2/3 on Style.\n\nRegarding conventions, the response includes some errors in capitalization (e.g., \"@CAPS2\", \"@NUM1\") and punctuation(use of \"...\"), but overall sentence structure, grammar, and spelling are generally correct. Thus, this warrants a score of 2/3 on Conventions.\n\nAfter evaluating each category using the rubric, the scores in each category would be summed to get the final score: 4 (Ideas) + 3 (Organization) + 2 (Style) + 2 (Conventions) = 11 out of a possible 15.\n\nSCORE: 11/15",

Therefore the student receives a 4/6.\n\nOrganization: The student\u2019s ideas are logically sequenced and our understanding it\u2019s hardly affected by the unclear marks. It's easy to follow the sequence of events from being patient on the plane, to waiting in the restaurant and finally getting their food. The flow is quite good.

The storytelling might have been more compelling with more varied sentence structure. Some repetition (e.g., '@NUM6 hours of patience, we finally got our food') hinder the quality of the narrative here. Therefore, the student gets a 2/3.\n\nConventions: The student generally makes good use of grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

Although the events appear to be sequenced, the links between the ideas are weak. The rubric indicates that \"organisation and connections between ideas and/or events are weak\" should be rated as 1/3.\n\nRegarding Style, it's evident that sentence structure is monotonous and lacks variety. Additionally, the student's word choice is somewhat confusing and unclear, which makes comprehending the narrative difficult.

However, transitions between events and clear connections between ideas could have been better. For example, the reason for the student's patience and motivation to help the elderly woman could have been better elucidated. This prompts a score of 2 for Organization.\n\nRegarding Style, the student exhibits a limited command of language, particularly evident in an almost monotonous sentence structure and a lack of variety in word choice.

And so, the student earns a score of 3 in the 'Organization' category.\n\nThe style of the writing is straightforward and unvaried, with simple sentence structures and word choice. The language used, while clear, does not fully support the writer's purpose of demonstrating patience, and the lack of compelling word choice suggests a score of 1 in the 'Style' category.\n\nFor 'Conventions', the student's grammar, punctuation, and usage of Standard English are mostly consistent and appropriate for the grade level.

However, the extended waiting for the horse to recover does represent the concept of patience but it's somewhat implicit. This suggests a score of 4 for Ideas.\n\nThe organization of the story is somewhat difficult to follow with quite a bit of unexplained dialogue and context. The story lacks clear sequencing and connections between ideas and events as some leap from one to another unexpectedly, such as the sudden introduction of the horse injury. Therefore, for Organization, the response would be assigned a score of 1. \n\nIn terms of writing style, the command of language is more limited due to inconsistent sentence structures and a heavy reliance on dialogue, often without clear speakers or contexts. They use mostly simple and repetitive word choices. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 1 for Style.\n\nRegarding conventions, the student\u2019s response faces significant struggles. There are multiple issues with grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation throughout the story that create confusion. Capitalization seems arbitrary, and several incomplete or run-on sentences are present. As such, it would be scored a 1 on Conventions.\n\nOverall, the student's response shows a clear effort to communicate a story about patience but struggles significantly with clarity, organization, style, and command of Standard English conventions.

        "marker": "The student's response tells a story around the theme of patience, centered on waiting for his grandmother so they could go to \"CAPS1 adventures\". The content communicated patience and aptly fit the question prompt. \n\nIn terms of Ideas, it falls in the 4 score range. The story is fairly focused on patience with the student's response on learning about the unexpected delay in their plans and his reaction, \"that\u2019s ok we can wait\". The story, however, doesn't provide a thoroughly developed situation of patience, it mainly describes a delay in plans which required some level of patience, so it does not fully fall into the scoring range of 6.\n\nRegarding Organization, the story is clearly organized, detailing events in chronological order. Therefore, the response fits into the scoring range of 3, since the organization and connections between ideas are effectively demonstrated throughout.\n\nAs for Style, the sentence structures and word choices used are quite basic. The student only shows adequate command of language without any effective and compelling word choice or varied sentence structure. Word redundancies are also apparent. Therefore, it falls within a score of 2. \n\nWhen looking at Conventions, the spelling is mostly correct, but there are numerous grammatical mistakes such as word redundancies and punctuation errors. This shows inconsistent language usage which falls under score 1.\n\nFinal scoring: Ideas=4, Organization=3, Style=2, Conventions=1 \nTotal: SCORE: 10/15",

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",
        "marker": "Ideas:\nThe student is clearly focused on the topic of patience and presents a thorough story to illustrate their experience with it. They provide multiple specific details to support their explanation, including the description of their wait to play the video game. The ideas here can be given a score of 6.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization and connections between ideas and events are clear and logically sequenced, from the introduction of the story to the resolution. The story progresses smoothly from the initial impatience to the understanding of the importance of patience. For this, the organization score can be given as 3.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's command of language is quite good. The voice is compelling and conversational, some sentence structuring is varied, though slang is used in certain areas. However, the student's purpose and audience are clearly supported throughout their work. The student\u2019s style score is 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation isn't entirely consistent. There are misspellings (\u2018Preaty\u2019, \u2018patiente\u2019), incorrect use of apostrophes (in place of quotation marks), and punctuation errors. These could have been avoided with an inspection for spelling and grammar issues. Therefore, a score of 1 seems appropriate for conventions. \n\nSCORE: 12/15.",

I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",
        "marker": "Ideas:\nThe student adequately focuses on the idea of patience being key to learning a new skill (makeup application), however, the development of this idea is a mix of specific and somewhat general details. This is seen in how the student discusses the importance of her mother's advice and her own progression from buying the makeup to understanding the need for patience, but does not delve deeper into her own feelings or use extensive details in relating her patient journey to proficiency. Score 4: Tells a story with ideas that are somewhat focused on the topic and are developed with a mix of specific and/or general details.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student\u2019s response follows a clear chronological sequence, from initial interest in makeup, the shopping excursion, the failed first trials, to the mother's lesson on patience. The story is logically sequenced, providing a clear path to the lesson learned. Score 3: Organization and connections between ideas and/or events are clear and logically sequenced.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's command of language is adequate. The word choice and sentence structures are generally clear and effective but lack extensive variety. The language supports the writer's purpose, making it relatable to a young audience. Score 2: Adequate command of language, including effective word choice and clear sentences, supports the writer's purpose and audience.\n\nConventions:\nGrammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are moderately consistent. However, there are certain errors noticeable. For instance, `patients` should be `patience` and there are formatting errors with the referred \"@\" symbols. Score: 1.5 (between score 1 for limited use and score 2 for adequate use of conventions of Standard English).\n\nOverall, the student generically addresses the concept of patience as it relates to learning a new skill and tells a cohesive, understandable story. The student's command of language is sufficient but falls short in regard to convention usage. \n\nSCORE: 10.5/15.",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": "Review:\n\nLooking at the first criterion on Ideas, the student has clearly narrated a story that is focused on patience. By teaching his little brother how to catch a football, the student has elaborated his story with specific details regarding the scenario, demonstrating his patience throughout the ordeal. He is awarded 6/6 points for this criteria.\n\nRegarding Organization, the student's ideas are logically sequenced as events unfold in his story about teaching his little brother how to play catch. There is a progressive development of the narrative, maintaining a clear connection between events. This warrants a score of 3/3.\n\nExamining Style, the student's command of language is limited, with a lack of variety in word choice and sentences. Although his language gets the message across, it isn't compelling or effective. There isn't much variety in sentence structures. Thus, he receives 1/3 points for this category.\n\nFinally, in terms of Conventions, the student's response contains some grammar and spelling errors. For example, \"alod\" instead of \"glad\", \"token\" instead of \"taken\", use of \"@CAPS1\" etc. represent spelling and grammar misuse. But, on overall, his usage of English standard language is still understandable. For this, he receives 1/3 points.\n\nSCORE: 11/15",
