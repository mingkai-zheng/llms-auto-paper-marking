        "marker": "Dear Local Newspaper,\n\nI am writing to express my belief that computers have a positive effect on society and to persuade the readers to agree with me. While some may argue that computers have negative impacts on individuals and society as a whole, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nOne of the main advantages of computers is their ability to enhance hand-eye coordination. With various online games and activities available, individuals can improve their reflexes, motor skills, and coordination. This is especially important for children and young adults as it helps them develop crucial skills early on.\n\nMoreover, computers provide us with the opportunity to learn about faraway places and people. With just a few clicks, we can access information about different cultures, traditions, and historical events from all over the world. This not only broadens our knowledge but also fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation for diversity.\n\nAdditionally, computers allow us to interact and communicate with people from various backgrounds. Through social media platforms and online forums, individuals can connect with others who share similar interests or engage in discussions on important issues. This opens up channels of communication that were previously unavailable, leading to a more interconnected global society.\n\nWhile some experts argue that excessive computer use leads to a lack of physical activity and limits face-to-face interactions, I believe that individuals have the autonomy to manage their time and maintain a balance. Computers can serve as a tool to facilitate exercise routines and provide access to virtual fitness classes. Moreover, online communication can supplement, rather than replace, offline interactions, as it allows people with busy schedules or physical limitations to stay connected with their loved ones.\n\nIn conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and society. They enhance hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about different cultures, and facilitate communication and connection with others. While it is essential to be mindful of our computer usage and maintain a balance with other activities, the benefits they offer far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n\nSCORE: 5/6",

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

        "marker": "Dear Editor,\n\nI am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people in our society. In my view, computers have had a significantly positive impact on individuals and communities.\n\nFirstly, computers have played a crucial role in enhancing hand-eye coordination. Through various interactive games and programs, individuals are able to develop their motor skills and hand-eye coordination. This is particularly important for children who are in their developmental stages. By engaging with computer-based activities, they can improve their dexterity and coordination, which can positively impact their overall physical development.\n\nAdditionally, computers provide people with the ability to learn about faraway places and different cultures. With just a few clicks, individuals can access information from all around the world. This access to knowledge allows individuals to broaden their horizons, understand diverse perspectives, and develop cultural awareness. This exchange of information and ideas enables societies to become more globally connected and fosters a sense of unity among people from different backgrounds.\n\nAnother significant benefit of computers is the ability to connect with others online. Through social media platforms, online forums, and video conferencing tools, individuals can interact and communicate with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. This connectivity has a positive effect on mental well-being by reducing feelings of isolation and promoting social connections. Moreover, online communication enables individuals to build international networks, collaborate on projects, and exchange ideas, further enriching society as a whole.\n\nWhile it is true that some experts express concerns about the negative effects of excessive computer use, such as reduced physical activity and limited face-to-face interactions, these issues can be addressed through proper time management and balance. Encouraging individuals to establish a healthy routine that includes physical exercise, outdoor activities, and quality time with loved ones is imperative. It is not the computer itself that poses a threat, but rather how it is utilized by individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of computers in our society outweigh any potential drawbacks. They enhance hand-eye coordination, facilitate the acquisition of knowledge about different cultures, and facilitate meaningful connections with others. It is essential that we recognize and embrace the positive impact that computers have on people's lives while also promoting a healthy and balanced approach to technology use.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Writer's Name]\n\nSCORE: 6/6",

Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it.

        "marker": "Dear Newstimes,\n\nI am writing to express my strong opinion on the effects of computers on people, and I believe that they have a highly positive impact on society. Computers provide numerous benefits to individuals, including improving hand-eye coordination, enabling global communication, and assisting in various tasks. In this letter, I will present compelling reasons why computers are beneficial and persuade the readers to agree with my viewpoint.\n\nFirstly, computers contribute to the development of hand-eye coordination. Many computer-based activities, such as video games and virtual simulations, require individuals to use their hands to manipulate objects on the screen. This interaction between the hands and eyes helps to enhance coordination skills, which can be valuable in everyday life. For example, a study conducted by the University of Rochester found that action video games improve hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and visual attention. By engaging with computers, people can not only have fun but also improve their cognitive abilities, which are crucial for various tasks and activities.\n\nSecondly, computers provide a platform to learn about faraway places and people. In today's interconnected world, it is vital for individuals to have a global perspective and a deep understanding of different cultures. Computers allow us to access vast amounts of information and connect with people from all around the world. For instance, through online platforms such as social media and video conferencing, individuals can participate in cultural exchanges, share experiences, and learn from individuals with diverse backgrounds. This exposure to different perspectives helps to promote tolerance, empathy, and a broader understanding of the world we live in.\n\nLastly, computers facilitate online communication, which can greatly enrich people's social lives. While some argue that spending too much time on computers isolates individuals from real-life interactions, I believe that computers provide avenues for people to connect and build relationships. Online platforms like chat groups and social media enable individuals to stay in touch with friends and family, especially those who live far away. Additionally, these platforms foster communities of shared interests, where people can find support, exchange ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals. A study conducted by the University of Michigan even found that online social interactions can help reduce loneliness and improve overall well-being. Computers bridge the gap of physical distance, allowing relationships to be sustained and new connections to be formed, ultimately enhancing our social lives.\n\nIn conclusion, the positive effects of computers on people cannot be underestimated. They promote hand-eye coordination, facilitate global learning, and enhance online communication. Although concerns about excessive computer usage may exist, when used in moderation, computers provide immense benefits to individuals and society as a whole.\n\nI urge the readers to recognize the importance of computers in our lives and embrace the opportunities they bring. By embracing computers, we can unleash their potential to enhance education, foster cross-cultural understanding, and strengthen human connections.\n\nThank you for considering my viewpoint.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nSCORE: 5/6",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": "Evaluation:\n\nThe student's response is a clear attempt to persuade readers that computers have a positive effect on people. However, there are several issues with the response that result in a lower score.\n\nFirst, the response lacks organization and coherence. The ideas are presented in a disorganized manner, with no clear introduction or conclusion. The response jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. This lack of organization makes it difficult for readers to follow the argument and understand the main points being made.\n\nSecond, the response lacks adequate support. While the student provides some reasons for why computers have a positive effect on people, these reasons are not well-developed or elaborated upon. For example, the student mentions that computers allow people to get needed information, but there is no explanation or example given to support this claim. Additionally, the response lacks specific details to back up the claims being made. The response would be stronger if the student provided concrete examples or evidence to support their points.\n\nFinally, the response shows a lack of awareness of audience. The tone and language in the response are informal and unprofessional, more appropriate for a casual conversation than a persuasive letter to a newspaper. Additionally, the response contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors, which further detract from the overall effectiveness of the argument.\n\nOverall, while the student attempts to persuade readers that computers have a positive effect on people, the lack of organization, inadequate support, and lack of awareness of audience all contribute to a lower score.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

The author describes Saeng's intense recognition and shock when she sees the blood-red hibiscus blossom, symbolizing her connection to her past and her longing for her home. Saeng's emotional reaction shows the significance of the plant in reminding her of her grandmother, the saebba hedge, and the well where she used to find the red blossom floating in the water. \n\nAdditionally, the author portrays Saeng's nostalgic memories through other plants she recognizes, such as the Madagascar periwinkle and the jasmine. Each plant triggers a specific memory associated with her grandmother and her childhood. The plants serve as reminders of what Saeng has lost and the deep sense of longing she feels. \n\nGiven these supporting details and examples from the story, it is clear that the author concludes the story with the paragraph to highlight Saeng's determination and resilience. Despite the wave of loss and the feeling of everything being gone, Saeng vows to take the driver's test again in the spring, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.
