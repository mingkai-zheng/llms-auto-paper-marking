        "marker": "Dear Local Newspaper,\n\nI am writing to express my strong belief that computers have a positive effect on society. In an increasingly digital world, computers offer countless benefits that improve our lives in numerous ways.\n\nFirstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination, which is essential in today's technologically-driven society. Whether it's using a mouse, typing on a keyboard, or playing video games, these activities require coordination between our hands and our eyes. By using computers, people can develop and refine their motor skills, which can have a positive impact on their overall productivity and efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, computers provide us with the ability to learn about faraway places and people. The internet is a vast resource of information, allowing us to access educational materials and explore different cultures from the comfort of our own homes. This not only expands our knowledge but also fosters a sense of curiosity and understanding towards the world around us.\n\nMoreover, computers enable us to connect and communicate with people from all over the globe. Social media platforms, online forums, and video conferencing tools have revolutionized the way we interact with others. Through these means, we can create friendships, engage in meaningful discussions, and collaborate on projects, regardless of geographical boundaries. This interconnectedness promotes empathy, tolerance, and a deeper sense of community.\n\nHowever, I understand that some experts raise concerns about the negative impact of excessive computer use on individuals. They argue that people are spending too much time on their computers, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and a decrease in face-to-face interactions.\n\nWhile it is essential to acknowledge these concerns, it is equally important to remember that responsible use of computers can mitigate these issues. Encouraging a balance between screen time and physical activities, promoting outdoor experiences, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining healthy relationships offline can help individuals harness the benefits of technology while still enjoying the abundance of the natural world.\n\nIn conclusion, computers undeniably have a positive effect on people and society. They foster cognitive and motor skills development, provide access to a world of information, and facilitate connections with others. By embracing these advancements while being mindful of their potential drawbacks, we can create a harmony between technological progress and a well-rounded, fulfilling life.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n\nScore: 5/6",

Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

However, the rest of the response fails to provide adequate support for this viewpoint.\n\nThe first reason provided is obesity. The student states that if people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise, it will cause obesity. While this is a valid concern, the response lacks specific details or evidence to support this claim. There is no explanation of how computers directly contribute to obesity or any statistics or studies to back up this statement.\n\nThe second reason given is cramps, which could be caused by spending too much time typing or sitting at a computer.

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",
        "marker": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1,\n\nI am writing to express my opinion regarding the effects of computers on people. In my belief, computers have a positive impact on individuals' lives. They provide numerous benefits and opportunities that contribute to the betterment of society.\n\nFirstly, computers promote social connectivity. With the rise of social media platforms and instant messaging programs, people can now interact and communicate with friends and family from faraway places. These technological advancements have eliminated the constraints of physical distance and allow individuals to maintain relationships regardless of their location. Social networking sites, for instance, enable us to share our lives through photos and updates, fostering a sense of connection and community. The social aspect of computers greatly enhances people's lives and is a valuable asset in today's society.\n\nFurthermore, computers serve as a gateway to knowledge and information. In the past, individuals had to rely on books and newspapers for research and learning. However, with the advent of computers, a vast amount of information is now readily available at our fingertips. Online databases and search engines allow for quick and efficient research on a wide range of topics. This accessibility to information not only aids in education but also fuels curiosity and intellectual growth. Computers empower individuals to delve deeper into subjects, expand their horizons, and stay informed about the world around them.\n\nLastly, computers play a crucial role in the dissemination of news and current events. With the rise of online news platforms, people no longer have to wait for printed newspapers to stay updated. Online news is fast, accessible, and offers real-time information on various topics. This immediacy of news has proven instrumental in times of disaster and crisis. For instance, during the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, online news platforms allowed individuals to quickly gather information, donate, and provide aid to those affected. Computers make it possible to respond promptly and effectively in times of need.\n\nWhile some argue that computers lead to a decrease in physical activity and social interactions, I believe that their benefits far outweigh any potential negatives. With proper time management and balance, individuals can enjoy the advantages of computers while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle and meaningful relationships. Moreover, computers have become an essential tool in today's society, facilitating communication, learning, and staying informed.\n\nIn summary, the use of computers has a positive effect on people. They enable social connectivity, provide access to a wealth of knowledge, and offer real-time news and updates. Computers are indispensable in our modern world, and their impact on society is undeniable. I urge the readers to embrace and appreciate the benefits that computers bring to our lives.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nSCORE: 5/6",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information.

        "marker": "Review:\n\nThe student's response is an attempt to persuade readers that computers have positive effects on people. However, the response falls short in several areas.\n\n1. Development: The response lacks sufficient development. The reasons given to support the argument are very general and lack elaboration. For example, the student mentions that computers teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway places, and enable online communication. However, there are no details or examples provided to support these claims. Without specific examples and elaboration, the arguments remain weak and unsubstantiated.\n\n2. Organization: The response lacks a clear structure. The paragraphs are disjointed and seem randomly placed. There is no clear introduction or conclusion, and the ideas within paragraphs are poorly connected. The lack of transitional language further contributes to the disjointedness of the response. This lack of organization makes it difficult for readers to follow the argument and weakens the persuasive effect of the response.\n\n3. Fluency and Mechanics: The response contains numerous grammatical errors and lacks coherence. There are inconsistencies in punctuation and capitalization, which make the response difficult to read and understand. The response also shows little awareness of audience, as it uses informal language and has a colloquial tone.\n\nBased on these weaknesses, I would assign this response a score of 2 out of 6. \n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",

The response is also difficult to read and understand due to numerous spelling and grammatical errors.\n\nThe response begins by stating the position that computers have a positive effect on people. However, there is no clear introduction or thesis statement to establish the purpose of the letter. The lack of organization and structure makes the response fragmented and unclear.\n\nThe first reason provided is that computers allow people to get needed information for projects and could help them get good grades. However, this reason consists of only general statements and lacks specific examples or details to support the point. The connection to the positive effect on people is not adequately explained.\n\nThe second reason presented is that adults use computers for work and planning, and without computers, many people would lose their jobs or miss important plans. While this reason does show some awareness of the consequences of not having computers, it is still lacking in specific details or examples to support the claim.\n\nThe third reason states that computers allow people to talk to friends and family around the world without spending extra money on phone calls. However, this reason is again presented in a general manner without any specific examples or evidence to support it.\n\nThe response briefly mentions that parents use computers to teach their children and that computers are used at schools to teach students important information. However, these points are presented without elaboration or specific evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response lacks specific details, adequate support, and clear organization. The ideas are not well-developed, and the response does not effectively persuade the readers to agree with the position. Additionally, the numerous spelling and grammatical errors make the response challenging to read and understand.\n\nScore: 2/6",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

This is supported by the text when the cyclist mentions seeing a ridiculously large snake blocking the majority of the pavement.\n\nFinally, the response mentions that the cyclist finds relief at a bait and tackle shop with lots of water. This is supported by the text when the cyclist stumbles into Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp and drinks deeply from the sink.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some examples from the text, it lacks development and fails to fully connect the examples to a conclusion or assertion about the text.

According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the \"blimps\". To solve the problem, they built a shaft to bring passengers down to the @NUM1 floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located.

The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.",
        "marker": "The student's response provides a clear and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. \n\nThe student correctly highlights the safety concern of using hydrogen-filled dirigibles. They mention that hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch fire above New York City, the consequences would be devastating. This is supported by the excerpt, which states, \"Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.\"\n\nThe response also addresses the obstacle presented by nature, specifically the constantly shifting winds on top of the building. The student points out that even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the wind could cause the back of the ship to swivel around, making it unsafe. They also mention the need to transmit the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible to the building's foundation, which required modifications and strengthening of the steel frame. These details are supported by the excerpt, which states, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents\" and \"The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.\"\n\nLastly, the student mentions the legal obstacle of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. They correctly point out that this would make it illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the building or even approach the area. This is supported by the excerpt, which states, \"The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.\"\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates an accurate understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt and is clear and complete. \n\nSCORE: 4/4",

The story flows smoothly, following a clear progression from one event to another.\n\nStyle: Score 2\nThe student demonstrates an adequate command of language, but there is limited variation in word choice and sentence structure. The style could be improved with more descriptive language and varied sentence structures.\n\nConventions: Score 2\nOverall, the student demonstrates an adequate use of conventions of Standard English.

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
