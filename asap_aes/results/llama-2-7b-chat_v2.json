        "marker": " After a thorough evaluation of the student's response, I have awarded the following score: SCORE: 4/6. Here are the reasons behind my grading decision, based on the provided rubric:\nScore Point 1: The student's response partially exhibits an undeveloped position on the topic of whether computers benefit or harm society. Although the writer acknowledges that computers have some benefits, such as connecting people faster and easier, the answer lacks detailed support and examples. Specifically, the writer could have provided more specific examples of how computers have improved communication, learning, or other aspects of society. Therefore, the response scored 1 out of 6 points for this section.\nScore Point 2: The response exhibits minimal organization, with the writer jumping between different ideas without a clear structure. The answer starts by stating that computers are good, then mentions their benefits, and finally acknowledges some concerns. To improve this section, the student could have addressed each point separately, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. As a result, the response scored 2 out of 6 points for this section.\nScore Point 3: The student provides some reasons for their position, but the support is inadequate and mostly generalized. For instance, the writer states that computers help people learn about faraway places, but does not provide specific examples or evidence to back this claim. To improve this section, the student could have provided more detailed examples of how computers have expanded access to information, education, or cultural exchange. As a result, the response scored 3 out of 6 points for this section.\nScore Point 4: Although the student shows some awareness of their audience by addressing the reader directly, their use of language and tone is generally flat and unengaging. The writer could have used more persuasive language and rhetorical devices to make their argument more compelling. Therefore, the response scored 4 out of 6 points for this section.\nScore Point 5: The response exhibits some signs of development, but the reasons for the position are still not fully elaborated. The student acknowledges both benefits and concerns about computers, but could have provided more detailed support for their position. For example, the writer could have discussed the potential negative impacts of excessive computer use, such as social isolation, decreased physical activity, or addiction. As a result, the response scored 5 out of 6 points for this section.\nScore Point 6: The response does not fully exhibit a clear, thoughtful position, and the support provided is still not persuasive enough. Although the writer acknowledges some concerns about computers, they could have provided more nuanced and well-researched arguments to support their position. Additionally, the response could have benefited from a more sophisticated use of language and rhetorical devices to engage the reader. Therefore, the response scored 6 out of 6 points for this section.\nIn conclusion, the student's response partially demonstrates a clear position on the topic, but lacks adequate support and development. While the writer shows some awareness of their audience and organization, the response could benefit from more detailed examples, persuasive language, and a clearer structure. Therefore, I have awarded a score of 4 out of 6.",

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

Say you don\u0092@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

        "essay": "Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons.

Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's.

Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers.

Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

The student also acknowledges the challenge of framing the mooring mast itself, which was required to be made of a skeleton of steel and clad in stainless steel with glass windows. They reference the excerpt to support this claim, highlighting the complexity of the mooring mast's design. (Score Point 4)\n3. The student notes that the wind currents on top of the building were another obstacle to successfully mooring a dirigible, as the ships would swivel around and around the mooring mast due to violent air currents. They provide evidence from the excerpt to support this claim, citing the unsolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height. (Score Point 4)\n4. The student correctly notes that the law against airships flying too low over urban areas was another factor that made it impossible for dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building. They reference the excerpt to support this claim, highlighting the captain's reluctance to fly the dirigible too close to the building due to safety concerns. (Score Point 4)\nIn conclusion, the student's answer is a detailed and accurate description of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

        "essay": "The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

The student identifies the following obstacles:\n1. Stress to the building's frame: The builders had to modify the building's steel frame to accommodate the mooring mast, which added stress to the building's structure.\n2. Safety concerns: The use of hydrogen in dirigibles was a major concern, as it is highly flammable, as demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster. Additionally, the builders were concerned about the wind patterns on top of the building, which made it difficult to moor the dirigibles securely.\n3. Legal obstacles: An existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.\nThe student's answer is mostly clear and accurate in describing these obstacles, but there are some minor errors and omissions. For example, the student mentions that the builders used lead weights to weight down dirigibles in open landing fields, but they do not note that this was not a viable option for the Empire State Building due to the building's height and the dangling nature of the dirigibles. Additionally, the student does not explicitly mention the problem of forceful winds on top of the building, which was a significant issue for the mooring mast design.\nBased on the rubric provided, I would award the following score:\nSCORE: 3/4.

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.",

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",

All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it.
