However, their argument lacks the development and elaboration required to be persuasive; they have not expanded upon their reasons or provided specific examples to support their statements.\n\nThe response is quite fragmented. The student fails to adequately articulate their thoughts due to poor use of punctuation, lack of transitional language, and abrupt transitions between ideas. This makes it difficult for the reader to follow the argument.\n\nIn terms of audience awareness, the student made an attempt to reach the audience with their position but did not clarify their reasons or points of view, making it difficult for the reader to connect or resonate with their opinion. \n\nBased on these points, the student's response aligns best with a Score Point of 1 according to the rubric. The student merely states their opinion without backing it up with significant detail. There is lack of organization, and the response might be difficult for some readers to understand.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

They have even outlined the major positive effects such as the enhancement of hand-eye coordination, the educational benefits of learning about far-away places and people, and the ability to communicate with family and friends online. However, they have only provided general details to support their stand. For example, they mentioned that games can improve reflexes and eyesight, but they failed to link this statement to a specific game or cite an example to substantiate their claim. The response also does not delve into how exactly computers allow one to learn about other places and people. They should have given an example or mentioned wherein this feature has been used for this purpose.\n\nIn terms of organization, the student's letter is reasonably presented. The student first outlined the benefits of computers and then delved into details about each, although not without flaws. However, they fall short in their conclusion as they fail to reiterate the benefits of computers succinctly and instead plead with the reader not to take computers away, which is slightly out of context.\n\nThere isn't much transition language in evidence, and sometimes their sentences aren't as fluent as they could be.

The student mentioned using computers to assist with homework and to get in touch with others online which shows an understanding of the assignment. Nevertheless, the efforts to offer specific examples and elaborate on them are minimal, leaving them largely under-developed. Particular phrases, like using a computer to \"connect with them on the computer,\" and, \"go on the for example you had important message,\" show confusion and make the argument hard to follow.\n\nFurthermore, the response lacks organization. Although the student tried to lay out clear points (using computers for homework help, for communication, and for checking important messages), the transitions between these points are awkward and there is no clear development or progression to the argument. While there is an attempt at a conclusion, it also lacks clarity and fails to effectively wrap up the letter.\n\nThere's also a lack of audience awareness, as indicated by the colloquial language and the use of phrases like: \"I do it all the time,\" and, \"I do it why can't you\". Moreover, the letter is filled with numerous grammatical errors and incorrect usage of words (for instance, 'Frist' instead of 'First', '@CAPS2'/'@CAPS1'/'@MONTH1'), which further obscurce the meaning.\n\nConsidering all of these factors, I would assign this response a Score Point 2. It takes a position and tries to provide general reasons and details to support that position, but the lack of sufficient elaboration, organization, and audience awareness, along with the prevalent awkwardness and confusion, hinder its effectiveness significantly. \n\nSCORE: 2/6",

First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

However, these explanations lack depth and often seem repetitive.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse.

However, the letter is not well-developed or persuasive in presenting these points of view. \n\nThe student's reasons are not well elaborated and lack specific details. For instance, the claim that computers cause obesity and lead to death is unsupported. The student employs hyperbolic statements like \"Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk\" without explaining how exactly these computers cause such drastic outcomes. This decreases the credibility of his arguments.\n\nThe organization of the response is weak. There is no clear, logical flow to the arguments, and the student jumps from one point to another without coherent transitions. For example, the point about nature is suddenly introduced without any connection to the previous points about computers causing obesity.\n\nIn terms of language fluency and sophistication, the response is inadequate. There are several spelling and grammatical errors, such as \"exsperiance\" for \"experience\", \"choping\" for \"chopping\", and \"torrocher\" for \"torture\". These errors make it difficult for the reader to understand the student's arguments.\n\nFurthermore, the response shows minimal awareness of the audience. The student does not use polite language (\"People are so fat! Wounder why.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "The provided student response is well-organized, takes a clear position, and provides specific details to support that stance. The position is that computers have a significant negative impact on individuals and society for a variety of reasons, namely contributing to obesity, causing physical discomfort, enabling sexual harassment, and promoting cyberbullying. \n\nThe letter starts by stating the student's position against the use of computers and then goes on to elaborate on their reasons in an organized manner, dealing with each reason in its individual paragraph. The examples provided, such as children gaining weight due to excessive computer use, teens experiencing cramps due to prolonged periods of fast and hard typing, and the risks of sexual harassment and cyberbullying in online chat rooms, are powerful illustrations of their arguments. \n\nHowever, the student could have benefited from using more transitional language and paying attention to the legibility of the writing. The letter could also display a more distinct awareness of the audience - local newspaper readers - who might expect a more formal tone. \n\nDespite these small drawbacks, the response is generally well-developed, thoughtful, and persuasive in proving the position of the student on the issue. Yet, it is somewhat off the top mark because of occasional lapses in fluency and slightly lacking audience awareness. \n\nScore: 5/6.",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony.

        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position arguing that computers have positive effects on people, particularly children. The letter proposes that computers facilitate learning, improving hand-eye coordination, and communication with others, and that children knowledgeable in computers can have successful careers. These reasons constitute the basis of the argument, identifying it as a developed response.\n\nHowever, the argument could be better supported with more detailed and specific information. For instance, while mentioning a study, the author does not specify the source or provide accurate data other than \"@PERCENT1\" which requires an actual number to provide a compelling piece of evidence.\n\nThe author discusses quite a general perspective like kids being tech-savvy, leading to them being successful, or becoming more social due to online interaction. Specific examples, like the case of the author's sister, strengthen the argument, but more such instances would make the argument more convincing. \n\nThe organization of the letter is satisfactory, although it could be further improved by distinguishing different points in individual paragraphs rather than merging all ideas into a single paragraph. Despite the organization's room for improvement, it still maintains coherency and logical flow. The author also provides relatable examples, demonstrating awareness of their audience: parents.\n\nThere is an attempt to use transitional language, although it often feels awkward or forced. Phrases like \"conversly\", \"if you have kids you know\", or \"I know you thinking there a lot of \" should be replaced with more sophisticated transitional phrases. Moreover, spelling errors and informal language usage (\"there a lot of\",\"ferm\", \"@CAPS4\" ) reduce the fluency and professionalism of the letter.\n\nBased on these factors, the student's response aligns most closely with score point 3. Though the letter establishes a clear position with reasons, it provides only a minimal elaboration, with mixed general and specific details. Even if the organization and audience awareness are adequate, fluency and transitional language use are somewhat lacking. \n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them.

They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

However, it could be enhanced with more fluid transitions to connect their ideas better.\n\nGiven these strengths and weaknesses, the response would receive a Score Point 4. This is because it is a somewhat developed response that takes a clear position and provides adequate but disjointed support. The language is moderately fluent and there is some awareness of the audience. The organization is satisfactory but could benefit from better transitions to connect ideas.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": "The student response takes a clear position in favor of computers having a positive effect on people, which is evident throughout the letter. The argument is fairly well-elaborated with a mix of general and specific details. They discuss the usefulness of computers for students, adults in work and planning situations, staying in contact with distant friends and family, and learning new things. These points provide a good spread of argumentation in favor of the positive effect of computers on people's lives. \n\nHowever, the letter is somewhat lacking in structure and organization. It contains several long sentences and run-on sentences, which make it difficult to read and fully understand certain arguments. The missing points include a proper introduction with a direct address to the editor or the readers, no clear partitioning of points into paragraphs, and a short, abrupt conclusion with a repetition of arguments from the main body rather than a summarization with fresh insight. The response exhibits moderate flexibility with language use, but could benefit from more transitional language to smooth over the flow of argumentation and make it more persuasive and readable. \n\nThere are also numerous spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors throughout the letter, which further hinder readability and credibility, and suggest a rush in constructing the letter. These errors do not show much audience awareness on the part of the student, as they can detract from the reader's understanding and agreement with the points being made.\n\nGiven these considerations, the response aligns best with Score Point 3. While it takes a position and presents numerous reasons in support, elaboration is minimal and general, organization is lacking, and the writing can be somewhat awkward due to long, convoluted sentences and various errors. There is some, albeit minimal, awareness of audience seen in the form of direct pleading to readers. \n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even \"swivel around the mooring mast.\" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, \"This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...\" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose.",

The response is organized and structured in a clear and easy-to-follow format, making it easier for the reader to comprehend the content.\n\nThe three significant challenges discussed by the student include safety, wind, and legal restrictions. The student accurately identifies and elaborates on these obstacles. For example, they correctly point out that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, raising significant concerns about fire safety. This is particularly true considering that a fire incident in a densely populated region like downtown New York would have catastrophic implications.\n\nOn the issue of wind, the student also correctly notes that the shifting winds and violent air currents at the top of the building posed a significant challenge. They highlight that the dirigible\u2019s untied back would thrash around and swivel around the mooring mast in these conditions, posing a risk to successful docking.\n\nFinally, the student underscores legal restrictions as a major obstacle to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. They effectively quote from the excerpt, \"This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area,\" to strengthen their argument on this point.\n\nThe student's response is clear, complete, and accurate. They successfully back their arguments with relevant and specific information from the excerpt. This helps enhance the credibility of the response and shows their thorough understanding of the subject matter. \n\nEvaluation:\n\nBased on these observations, I would assign the student's response a score of 4 out of 4. This score is a reflection of the student's successful fulfillment of all the requirements of the task. They have given a clear, complete, and accurate description, utilising related, specific information from the excerpt, thereby demonstrating a high degree of comprehension.\n\nSCORE: 4/4.",

Each point the student raised was substantiated with specific information from the excerpt, enhancing the quality of their response. Additionally, the student's response is well-organised and coherent, which contributes to its overall clarity.

The prompt asked for a story revolving around the theme of 'patience', but the student appears to have misunderstood the task, talking about 'loyalty' instead. \n\nIn terms of 'Ideas', the response fails to offer a focused narrative about a person being patient. Since no story about patience was shared, it is impossible for it to be developed with specific, relevant details. The response really isn't focused on the task at hand, earning it a score of 0.\n\nThe 'Organization' of the response is also lacking. The organization and connections between ideas are supposed to be clear and logically sequenced, but since the student has written outside the scope of the given question, the organization and sequencing of ideas about patience cannot be properly evaluated. However, judging from the structure and lack of a conclusive thought, organization is weak, affording a score of 1.\n\nLooking at 'Style', the single sentence provided is simple in structure and the vocabulary used is basic. The inappropriate use of language (mixing up 'patience' and 'loyalty') further limits the effectiveness of the response. Therefore, the score given is 1.\n\nLastly, in terms of 'Conventions', grammar and spelling errors are evident in the response such as the misspelling of \u201cpeople\u201d and sentences not ending with a period or question mark. Because of such persistent errors, the score of this criterion would be 1.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is an effort to write, it is off-topic and riddled with mistakes in grammar and spelling showing that the student has not understood the task at hand clearly.\n\nSCORE: 3/15",

Although the student argues for the simplicity of being patience, he fails to establish a clear lead, middle, and conclusion. Therefore, I would assign a score of 1 for organization. \n\nAs for style, the student could certainly utilize better language and sentence structure. The work reads more like a casual conversation than a well-thought-out piece of academic writing, with such informal language as \"Everyone absouletly knows that\" and \"There is no way you can\u2019t be patient for at leat @NUM1 or @NUM2 minutes.\" The student does not use a variety of word choices and sentences. I would award a score of 1 for style. \n\nOn the final category, conventions, the student made numerous errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. There are missing punctuations, incorrect usages of words, and awkward sentence structure. Mistakes are common throughout this piece which shows a limited use of standard English conventions.

The context in which the student was required to be patient is clear, but the overall story lacks elaboration. Therefore, in terms of Ideas, the response deserves a 4, since the ideas expressed are somewhat focused on the topic and developed with a mix of specific and general details. \n\nIn terms of Organization, while the ideas seem logically sequenced, the student does not effectively use transitions or connecting words. The main event, the conversation with the doctor, is introduced abruptly and the overall flow of the story is inconsistent.

There is little variety in sentence structure and their piece lacks effective word choice. The repeated use of the word '@CAPS1' and the phrase '@CAPS4 you' becomes redundant and can make the paragraph sound monotonous, attributing them a score of 1 for Style. \n\nLastly, the student's Conventions of Standard English are inadequate.
