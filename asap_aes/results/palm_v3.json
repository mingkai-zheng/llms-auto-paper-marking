Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

        "marker": "**Score: 3/6**\n\nThe student's response is minimally-developed and takes a position, but with inadequate support and details. The response is organized, but awkward in parts with few transitions. The student shows some awareness of audience.\n\nThe student's response takes a position that computers are \"handy\" and \"a necessity.\" However, the student does not provide adequate support for this position. The student lists some of the ways that computers can be helpful, such as online shopping, chatting, and streaming video. However, the student does not provide any evidence to support the claim that computers are \"handy\" or \"a necessity.\"\n\nThe response is also awkward in parts. For example, the student writes, \"Chatting become something that almost 90% of the world uses.\" This sentence is grammatically incorrect and difficult to read. The student also does not use transitions to connect the ideas in the response.\n\nFinally, the student shows some awareness of audience. The student addresses the reader as \"you\" and uses the word \"we\" to refer to people who use computers. However, the student does not clearly explain why the reader should care about the topic of the response.\n\nOverall, the student's response is minimally-developed and takes a position, but with inadequate support and details. The response is organized, but awkward in parts with few transitions. The student shows some awareness of audience.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\nThe student could improve the response by providing more support for the position that computers are \"handy\" and \"a necessity.\" The student could provide evidence from research studies or personal experience to support the claim. The student could also use transitions to connect the ideas in the response and make it more fluid. Finally, the student could clearly explain why the reader should care about the topic of the response.",
