You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "marker": " The student's response to the prompt is a letter to the editor expressing their opinion on the benefits of computers for society. The response has some positive aspects, but it also shows several areas for improvement.\n\nFirstly, the student takes a clear position in the introduction, stating that computers are beneficial for society. However, the supporting reasons provided are not well-elaborated, and the details are mostly general. For instance, the first reason given is that computers allow people to learn about other countries and cultures, but the student does not provide any specific examples or explain how this benefit works. Similarly, the second reason, which is about communication, is also not developed further.\n\nThe organization of the response is also underdeveloped. The student jumps between different ideas without a clear structure or transitional phrases to connect them. For example, the letter starts with a mention of people having different opinions on computers, but then abruptly shifts to the benefits of computers without addressing the opposing viewpoints. Moreover, the student uses a rather informal tone, which is not suitable for a letter to the editor.\n\nAnother issue with the response is the language and grammar usage. There are several instances of awkward phrasing, fragmented sentences, and grammatical errors. For instance, in the second paragraph, the student writes, \"Also because it's another source of communication,\" which is a awkward way to phrase it. Additionally, the student uses the phrase \"you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1,\" which is not clear or concise.\n\nConsidering the rubric, the student's response scores around 2-3 out of 6.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

The response meets all the criteria for a developed response, including a clear position, adequate support, and satisfactory organization. The student also shows a generally strong awareness of audience and uses moderately fluent language throughout. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved.\n\nFirstly, some of the sentences are awkwardly phrased or wordy, which can make the message less clear. For example, the student writes, \"The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos.\" This sentence could be rephrased for clarity and concision, such as, \"The computer provides access to a vast array of videos, including those on YouTube and Google.\"\n\nSecondly, while the student acknowledges potential negative effects of computers, the response could benefit from a more nuanced discussion of these issues. For example, the student could have explored the impact of excessive screen time on mental health or the potential for technology to replace human interaction.\n\nLastly, while the student uses some persuasive language, the response could be more convincing overall. The student could have used more specific examples or data to support their argument, or employed more rhetorical devices to make their message more compelling.\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response is well-developed and effectively argues in favor of the positive effects of computers on people.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

Below is a detailed assessment of the response using the provided rubric, focusing on the four score points:\n\n1. Content:\n\t* The letter takes a clear position on the topic but lacks concrete evidence and examples to support the writer's claims.\n\t* The writer mentions four reasons why computers are bad for society: obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. However, they fail to provide specific details or data to back up their assertions.\n\t* General statements and unsubstantiated claims are present throughout the response, detracting from the writer's argument.\n\t* No explicit connections are made between the reasons and the main topic of the letter, which weakens the overall effect.\n2.

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": " The student's response to the prompt is a letter to the editor expressing their opinion on the negative effects of computer usage on people. The response is somewhat developed, with a mix of general and specific details, but lacks persuasive support and sophisticated organization.\n\nFirstly, the response takes a clear position, stating that computers have a negative effect on people, but the supporting reasons are not fully elaborated. The student mentions a few potential negative effects, such as spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, but these points are not developed in detail. For example, the student could have provided specific examples of how excessive computer usage has led to a decrease in physical activity or social interaction.\n\nSecondly, the organization of the response is somewhat awkward, with abrupt transitions between ideas and a lack of clear connections between the different points. The student jumps between different topics, such as the importance of exercise, the impact on social relationships, and the idea of \"enjoying nature,\" without effectively linking them to the main argument. This lack of cohesion makes the response difficult to follow and understand.\n\nThirdly, the writing style is generally straightforward, but there are some awkward phrases and sentences that detract from the overall effectiveness of the response. For instance, the student writes, \"No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like,\" which could be rephrased more clearly and concisely. Additionally, there are some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses, which suggest a need for further editing and refinement.\n\nLastly, the response does not show a strong awareness of the audience, as the student does not address the readers directly or acknowledge potential counterarguments. A more effective response would engage the reader by posing questions, using rhetorical devices, or acknowledging opposing viewpoints.\n\nBased on these factors, I would score this response as follows:\n\n* Content: 2/3 (The response takes a clear position, but the supporting reasons are not fully elaborated, and the organization is somewhat awkward.)\n* Writing Style: 2/3 (The writing is generally clear, but there are some awkward phrases and sentences, and some grammatical errors detract from the overall effectiveness.)\n* Audience Awareness: 1/2 (The response does not show a strong awareness of the audience, with little direct address or engagement.)\n\nTotal Score: 5/6\n\nTherefore, I would give the student's response a score of 5/6. While the response takes a clear position and has some persuasive elements, it could be improved by providing more specific details, better organization, and a stronger awareness of the audience.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

However, the student's explanation of the safety obstacle is not entirely accurate. While it is true that hydrogen is flammable, the student's use of the term \"aerodynamic\" is incorrect. The fact that dirigibles are not aerodynamic does not contribute to the safety concern. Instead, the safety concern is related to the potential for fire due to the use of hydrogen.\n\nThe student's explanation of the second obstacle, nature, is also not entirely accurate. The student mentions that the winds blew the blimps off target, but this is not the primary issue related to nature. The primary issue related to nature is the fact that winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, making it difficult to moor the dirigible safely.\n\nThe student's explanation of the third obstacle, the law, is accurate.

        "essay": "There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be \"modified and strengthened,\" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the \"mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose\". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were \"constantly shifting due to violent air currents\". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas.

The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone.

This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction.

My siblings are also patient and wait for the school year to end. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his baits dects which is takeing a long time plus all the whineing from my sister and mom about why we don't need one. I'm  always patient when I have to got the school day over with my brother can be patient when he has to sit and wait for about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to load.

Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's response tells a story about patience in their family, specifically highlighting situations where family members have shown patience. However, the ideas are not always clearly focused on the topic, and some details seem a bit off-topic. For example, the student mentions their siblings waiting for the school year to end, but this doesn't directly relate to the topic of patience. Additionally, some of the details provided are quite general, such as the statement that their dad has to be patient while deployed. To improve, the student could have provided more specific examples of how their family members demonstrated patience in challenging situations. Score: 4/6\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's response has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and they attempt to connect their ideas by discussing how different family members have shown patience. However, some of the transitions between ideas are a bit clunky, and the organization could be improved. For instance, the student jumps abruptly from discussing their dad's deployment to their siblings waiting for the school year to end. To improve, the student could have used more cohesive transitions and clearer connections between ideas. Score: 2.5/3\n\nStyle:\nThe student's response demonstrates some variety in sentence structure, but the language use is generally simple and lacks sophistication. The student relies heavily on simple sentences, which makes the response feel a bit choppy. Additionally, some of the word choices are not particularly effective; for example, the student uses the phrase \"sitting in the office\" to describe their mom's work, which doesn't convey much detail or imagery. To improve, the student could have used more descriptive language and varied sentence structures to engage the reader. Score: 2/3\n\nConventions:\nThe student's response demonstrates consistent use of conventions, with minimal errors in grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are a few minor errors, such as missing commas and incorrect verb tenses. To improve, the student could have proofread their response more carefully to catch these errors.

However, the ideas could be more focused and developed, and the organization and style could be improved. Additionally, while the conventions are generally strong, there are a few minor errors that detract from the overall score.",

The student only shares one personal experience of being a patient, and the details provided are minimal. The response does not provide any specific examples or descriptions of how patience was demonstrated or beneficial. Therefore, I would score this category as 2, as the ideas are minimally focused on the topic and developed with limited details.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the response is weak. The student jumps abruptly from defining patience to sharing a personal experience without connecting the two ideas logically. There is no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and the transitions between ideas are not smooth. Therefore, I would score this category as 1, as the organization and connections between ideas are weak.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but there is room for improvement. The sentence structure is mostly simple, and the word choice is not varied. The response does not demonstrate a command of language that clearly supports the writer's purpose and audience. Therefore, I would score this category as 2, as the command of language is adequate but does not effectively support the writer's purpose and audience.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is inconsistent. There are errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation throughout the response. For example, \"patient\" should be capitalized, \"been\" should be \"being,\" \"trying\" should be \"try,\" and there should be a comma after \"hospital\" in the first sentence. Therefore, I would score this category as 1, as the use of conventions is limited and inconsistent.\n\nSCORE: 6/15\n\nOverall, the student's response could benefit from more developed ideas, better organization, and a stronger command of language conventions. While the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic, the response could be improved with more specific examples and details, clearer connections between ideas, and more attention to sentence-level conventions.",

The idea of waiting for something you want is certainly relevant to the topic, but the story itself is quite simple and lacks specific details. The student doesn't provide any examples of how they felt during the waiting period or how they dealt with the delay.

However, the connections between ideas and events are not particularly strong, and the transitions could be smoother.

The student tells a story about a time when they had to be patient while waiting in line for a roller coaster ride. The idea is relevant to the topic and is somewhat focused, but it could be more thoroughly developed. The student provides some specific details about the ride and the experience, but the story could benefit from more descriptive language and sensory details to make it more engaging. Therefore, I would give this aspect of the answer a score of 4.\n\nNext, let's look at the organization of the answer. The student's answer is logically sequenced, but the connections between ideas and events could be clearer. The student jumps abruptly from talking about being patient to describing the roller coaster ride without much of a transition. Additionally, the conclusion could be more concise and summarize the main point of the story better. Therefore, I would give this aspect of the answer a score of 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the style of the answer. The student's language use is adequate, but it could benefit from more varied sentence structure and compelling word choice. The student uses simple sentences and lacks descriptive language, which makes the answer feel a bit flat. However, the student does use some persuasive language when describing the ride and the importance of patience.

The student consistently uses proper grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are a few minor errors in punctuation and capitalization. For example, the student writes \"OMG!\" instead of \"OMG!\" and doesn't capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence.

They run inside to tell their mom and grandmother about their plan and have to wait for their grandfather to arrive before they can go outside and try riding their bike.\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's ideas are somewhat focused on the topic of patience. They provide specific details about their birthday and their desire to ride their bike without training wheels, but the story does not fully convey the idea of patience. The student does not explain why they had to wait for their grandfather or how they felt while waiting, which would have helped to develop the idea of patience further. Score: 4/6\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the story is logical, but there are some areas where it could be improved. The student jumps abruptly from talking about their birthday to wanting to ride their bike without training wheels. It would have been helpful to provide more context about why they wanted to do this and why it was important to them. Additionally, the story does not have a clear conclusion, it just ends with the student and their family members going outside. Score: 2/3\n\nStyle:\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but there is room for improvement. They use simple sentences and basic vocabulary, which makes the story feel a bit flat.

        "marker": " Sure, here's my evaluation of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, but the ideas are not thoroughly developed. The student provides some specific details, such as the elderly woman's struggle with her groceries and the main character's (@CAPS1) efforts to help her, but the story lacks depth and complexity. The student could have elaborated more on the woman's struggles, @CAPS1's thoughts and feelings, and the impact of the encounter on both characters. Therefore, I would score this criterion as a 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story has a clear sequence of events, but the organization could be improved. The transitions between paragraphs are a bit abrupt, and some details seem out of place. For instance, the mention of @CAPS2 and @CAPS4 in the first paragraph doesn't seem necessary to the story. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to create a clearer image of the setting and the characters. Thus, I would score this criterion as a 3.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's writing style is straightforward and easy to understand, but it lacks sophistication and finesse. The sentence structure is mainly simple, and the vocabulary could be more varied. The student uses some figurative language, such as \"completely untrue,\" but it's not enough to elevate the writing to a higher level. Also, there are some errors in capitalization, punctuation, and spelling (e.g., \"font\" instead of \"front\", \"your\" instead of \"you're\"). Therefore, I would score this criterion as a 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate but not perfect. There are some errors in capitalization, punctuation, and spelling, as mentioned earlier. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in the use of quotation marks and formatting. For example, the student uses both single and double quotation marks throughout the story. Moreover, there are some missing words and awkward phrasing, such as \"sort of knew her, so he said that he @CAPS4 help the woman\" instead of \"sort of knew her, so he offered to help the woman.\" Therefore, I would score this criterion as a 2.\n\nSCORE: 14/15\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the topic of patience, but it could be improved in terms of depth, organization, style, and conventions. The student shows potential in storytelling, but the writing needs more attention to detail and refinement to meet the criteria for a higher score.",

Here's a step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide specific details about their experience waiting for food at a restaurant. They also describe their feelings of hunger and how they didn't complain or yell, showing their patience. However, the story is a bit simple and lacks depth. The student could have expanded on their feelings, the setting, or the impact of their patience on the situation. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story has a clear structure, starting with a brief introduction, describing the situation, and ending with the outcome. The connections between ideas and events are logical, but the transitions could be smoother. For example, the student could have used transitional phrases to connect their feelings of hunger to their decision to wait patiently. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 3.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's language use is generally effective, but there are some areas for improvement. They use simple sentences and vocabulary, which makes their writing clear but not particularly engaging. Additionally, there are some errors in capitalization and punctuation, such as missing commas and incorrect usage of quotation marks. However, the student does use some descriptive language, such as \"waited patiently\" and \"getting more and more hungry,\" which adds depth to their story. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is adequate, but there are some errors. They correctly use quotation marks to set off the waiter's words, but they forget to close the quotation marks in one instance. Additionally, there are some grammar errors, such as using \"I was getting\" instead of \"I got\" and \"I didn't start complaining or yelling\" instead of \"I didn't complain or yell.\" However, the student does use proper capitalization and punctuation throughout their story. Therefore, I would give this section a score of 2.\n\nSCORE: 11/15\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the topic of patience, but could benefit from more depth, detail, and refinement in their ideas, organization, and style.

However, the story could have been more thoroughly developed. For example, the student could have described more specifically what they did to be patient, or what they learned from the experience. Therefore, I would give this category a score of 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, and the connections between ideas and events are clear. The student starts by describing the situation, explains why they had to be patient, and then describes how they handled the situation. However, there are some minor issues with organization. For example, the student jumps between different ideas within the story without connecting them smoothly. Additionally, the student could have used more descriptive language to make the story more engaging. Therefore, I would give this category a score of 2.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's writing is clear and understandable, but it lacks variety in word choice and sentence structure.

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it.
