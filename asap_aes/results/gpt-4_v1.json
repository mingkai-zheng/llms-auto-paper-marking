For example, the student claims that people need computers to look for jobs and communicate with friends, but does not elaborate or provide specific details to back these points. \n\n- The structure of the response is fragmented and awkward.

The statements are disconnected and somewhat difficult to read, which is yet another attribute of a Score Point 1 response.\n\n- Lastly, the student shows little to no awareness of the audience. This was supposed to be a letter to a newspaper, intended to persuade the readers, however the response lacks any formal structure or persuasive elements typically found in such writings.\n\n- Though the response does technically take a position - which could have potentially qualified it for a higher score point - the lack of elaboration, organization, and audience awareness lead to it being graded as Score Point 1. \n\nAccording to the given rubric: \n\nSCORE: 1/6",

The student does take a clear stance, supporting the idea that computers are useful and positive. Even though the student mentions that people may tend to spend too much time on computers, they balance this point by mentioning that computers are often used for productive work.\n\n2. The ideas are generally arranged in an orderly way, though transitions between points could be smoother.\n\n3.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

However the reasons and details provided to support this position are heavily generalized and aren't as fully or clearly elaborated as they could be.\n\nThe first reason discussed is that computers can aid in research or provide help when needed. This is a valid point, but the examples given (\"@CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also they can go on a website called http.historywork.com\") are limited in their effectiveness due to sentence structure and clarity issues.\n\nThe second reason given is that computers can be used to maintain connections with people.

There is an attempt at organization with the individual reasons outlined, but the points don't connect fully to one another and the transition between them could be improved.\n\nThere is a persistent difficulty with syntax and grammar affecting comprehension. This combined with frequent use of placeholders such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @MONTH1 shows a lack of careful editing and readability.\n\nBased on these points, I would assign the score point 2. \n\nIn summary, while the student has established a clear standpoint and provided general reasons to back it up, there is a lack of elaboration and clarity. Additionally, issues regarding syntax and grammar also detract from the overall strength and persuasiveness of the argument.

First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers.

They give relevant examples and offer some details to substantiate their claims, such as the ability to research foreign countries and historical events, and instant communication. This is indicative of a response that takes a position and offers some support.\n\nHowever, there are several shortcomings in the response that prevent it from obtaining a higher score. The first is its organization. While the letter has sections discussing different arguments, they practically blend into one another due to the absence of clear transitions. This lack of fluency and suspense coupled with limited control over language, which is at times confusing or vague, limits the effectiveness of their argumentation.\n\nMoreover, the letter lacks depth in the development of the ideas. The points touched upon had the potential to be well-fleshed-out arguments but end up seeming like brief overviews of the subject matter. Furthermore, in terms of audience awareness, they show limited connectivity and attempt to persuade the audience but shortcomings in their prose and organization make for a moderately engaging read.\n\nIn conclusion, the response seems to fall between Score Point 2 and Score Point 3 criteria, but it leans more toward Score Point 3. While lacking in several aspects, it does take a clear position and provides relevant, albeit underdeveloped, arguments with elements of organization.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

The reasons offered are wide-ranging, including education, entertainment, and communication, and are backed up with concrete examples like using Facebook for communication, playing video games for hand-eye coordination, using the computer for research, and watching videos on Youtube. This makes the position thoughtful and well-supported.\n\nRubric Point 2: The organization in the response is strong. The student starts by stating that there are both positive and negative effects of computer use, breaks down several points in favor of that argument, and then concludes by summarizing their position. The flow of the response is therefore easy to follow and logical, showing strong organization.\n\nRubric Point 3: The response is fluent and uses transitional language effectively. The student uses phrases like \"for example,\" \"I think,\" \"I also do,\" \"I myself like,\" which serve as good transitions between different ideas. This enhances the fluency of the response.\n\nRubric Point 4: There is a consistent awareness of the audience. The student began the letter by addressing the editor and consistently maintained a conversational tone throughout. This tone makes the argument more persuasive, as it acknowledges the audience and their potential skepticism.\n\nGiven the evidence and the strong response, this student's answer would earn a high score.

Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "The student's response clearly states their opinion on the subject matter, taking a clear position that they believe computers are more detrimental than beneficial. \n\nIn terms of the provided details and elaboration, the response presents four main points: obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. Although the student expounds on each with a degree of specificity, the examples and reasonings are generally simplistic, fragmented, and sometimes confusing. For instance, the part about kids starting off at @NUM1 pounds and gaining weight due to excessive computer use is unelaborated and the transition to the next point about cramps is abrupt and phraseology like \"tip-top-tip-top\" is unclear. The discussion of sexual harassment and bullying online is somewhat clearer, albeit still simplistic.\n\nThe student's work displays a minimal degree of organization with clear paragraphs addressing each point, but transitions between ideas are lacking, and there's a disconnect between premise and conclusions, such as the assertion that families may become broke or lose their home because of cyberbullying. The writing can be awkward in parts and sometimes difficult to understand.\n\nAwareness of the audience is demonstrated by the student taking the format of a letter to a local newspaper and also inviting readers to think about the issue and share their own thoughts at the end. However, the overall tone is not entirely suited to the format, and the fragmented and disjointed reasoning may make the arguments less persuasive to readers.\n\nBased on this evaluation and referencing the provided rubric, the student's response falls into Score Point 3 category - a minimally-developed response that takes a position but with inadequate support and details.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",
        "marker": "The student's response to the question takes a clear position that computers are beneficial. They provide three main reasons: it aids communication, it helps during emergencies, and it assists in managing finances. However, the details provided to support these main points are poorly elaborated, quite vague and not specific. For example, their mention of video chatting and 'a thing called @CAPS1' lacks clarity and specificity. This problem is also apparent in their second point about emergencies and their third point about managing money. \n\nIn terms of organization, the response is somewhat structured, as illustrated by the beginning, middle and end. Nonetheless, overall flow is hindered by awkward phrasings, lack of transitions, poor grammar and spelling which causes confusion. For example, 'there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency.' is difficult to understand. \n\nThe response demonstrates little awareness of its intended audience\u2014the local newspaper readership. The tone and language of the response feels more like a casual conversation with a friend rather than a persuasive letter. The letter is filled with informal language, slang, and grammatical errors and lacks the required decorum formal letters need. \n\nOverall, the student\u2019s letter would be rated a Score Point 3. It takes a position and provides reasons, but with minimal elaboration, awkward phrasing, and little awareness of audience.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

Computers are a very good thing for kids to have. I teaches them life skills such as hand-eye coordination, a lot about technology. Expert @PERSON1 states \"@PERCENT1 of success full jobs involve some kind of inter-ation with computers, & if they learn those skills at an early age they can soon become experts.\" Technology is a @CAPS1 part of life today, & will continue increasing with the years. It's a grevious idea to want to separate our kids from technology. As a child, my sister grew up with computers, she knew how to fully use it by age @NUM2, she went to collage with amazing computer skills. Today she works in a law ferm as presidental secretary. She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future.

So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4. As you can see computers can be seen in a very possotive manner. Heed my advice & allow your kids the freedom of internet. They will be happier, trust me.",
        "marker": "The student's response does adhere to the prompt, incorporating some elements of persuasion and argumentation into the answer. They take up a clear position in favor of children's engagement with computers. The student makes use of specific examples, such as a sister who learned computer skills early and is now successful in a law firm and cousins who use the computer for study and communication. The student also references vague figures to bolster the argument, such as \"@NUM1,\" \"@PERCENT1,\" and \"@NUM4 out @NUM5\". \n\nHowever, the response suffers from a lack of clear organization and sentence structure. There are run-on sentences and awkward phrasing throughout, making it hard to follow. Transitions between arguments and main points are either poorly executed or non-existent, giving the letter a disjointed feel. It seems like the student tried to include a lot of points, but did not manage to connect them all together in a meaningful way. \n\nFurthermore, the student uses incorrect spellings and grammar ('a grevious idea', 'ferm', 'succesfull', 'possotive'), which also detract from the overall quality of the piece. While the student does show some awareness of audience, as the letter is directed at parents of children, there are sections where this focus gets lost.\n\nThe use of quotations from hypothetical experts can be seen as an attempt to convey authority on the subject, but these quotes are presented without context or proper citations and are thus less effective. \n\nThe response shows elements of two score points from the rubric. \nFrom score point 3 typical elements, the response takes a position with minimal elaboration and more general than specific details. It shows some organization and awareness of audience. Overlaps also exist with score point 4, with the response providing adequate support and trying to include transitional language. \n\nConsidering these aspects, the student's piece falls somewhere between score points 3 and 4. Since the weaknesses (unorganized structure, run-on sentences, awkward phrasing, and poor grammar) outweigh the strengths (clear position, use of a variety of persuasive elements, some specific examples), a score at the lower end of the two seems more appropriate.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position that overuse of computers has a negative effect on people's lives, reducing the time for exercise, enjoyment of nature, and quality time spent with family and friends. Nevertheless, while the student's stance is noticeable and in alignment with the question's requirements, the substantiation for the argument lacks enough elaboration and depth.\n\nStarting with the letter's structure, the student displays an adequate organization of ideas. Each paragraph touches upon one of the potential negative impacts of spending too much time on computers. However, the transitions between paragraphs and ideas within them could be smoother and their connection better established.\n\nThe response also offers adequate elaboration of reasons with a mix of general and specific details. For instance, when the student mentions exercise, they explain that people are so engrossed in computer activities like games or chatting that they neglect physical fitness. However, they could have significantly enriched their argument by providing statistics or references to concrete studies demonstrating the negative effects of sedentary computer use.\n\nThe fluency of the student's letter is inconsistent. Some sections read smoothly whereas others show awkward sentence structures and occasional grammatical errors, like a lack or overuse of punctuation facilitatig both flow and comprehension. \n\nLast but not least, the student shows adequate awareness of the audience. They use direct questions to engage the readers, and their choice of topics indicates an understanding of potentially relatable issues for the general public.\n\nTo conclude, the student successfully addresses the task but could improve in terms of elaboration of ideas, fluency of language, and transition work. But considering the demand of the examination question and the limitations provided in the rubric score points 1 - 6, the student hits the mark for a score point 4.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",
        "marker": "The student's response clearly takes a position supporting the viewpoint that computers have a positive impact on society. The letter adequately explains the three main reasons for this position: social interaction, news dissemination, and efficient research.

This shows the student's understanding and knowledge on the subject, fitting the first criteria for score point 5.\n\nThe letter is organized well with clear transitions between the reasons, supporting the second criteria for score points 5 and 6. The student begins by stating their position then elaborates on each of the three reasons in separate paragraphs. This organization makes the reasons for the student's position clear to the reader and easy to follow.\n\nWhile the student uses transitional language throughout the letter, it isn't particularly sophisticated (e.g., \"a computer is to talk to someone without physically being there\"). This seems more fitting for score point 5 criteria.\n\nFinally, the student shows awareness of the audience, addressing counter-arguments at the end of the letter: \"The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.\" They maintain a professional tone throughout the letter, aiding in clarity and persuasion. \n\nMinor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"a proposterous motion\", \"Recall through endless information\") hinder the fluency of the letter. Moreover, their uses of '@LOCATION1' and '@LOCATION2' rather than specifying real places show a lack of specificity, seated more in score point 4. \n\nBased on these elements of the response, the student's answer is fitting for the 5th criteria on the rubric. \n\nSCORE: 5/6.",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

They provide arguments that offer support for their position, giving details such as allowing people to learn about faraway places, simplifying school work and allowing people to keep track and communicate with others from great distances.\n\nWhile the student presents detailed arguments in support of their position, the elaboration is not adequately done. Most of the points argued could have benefitted from further discussion to fully bring out the intended meaning. For instance, the submission that computers help promote exercise would have benefitted from further explanation beyond simply saying computers provide advertisements for gyms and travel agencies.\n\nThe student also does well to show some level of organization in their writing. The response is divided into paragraphs discussing different aspects that the student believes outlines the benefits of computer use. However, the paragraphs could benefit from better transitioning to allow for a smooth link between the various aspects. It is also somewhat difficult to read due to occasional confusion in syntax and capitalization.\n\nThe student shows a reasonable awareness of their audience, which is evident in their use of examples and scenarios that could relate to the readers of a newspaper. However, the awkward language usage and formatting may detract from the clarity of the message which could affect the reactions and understanding of some readers. There are also several spelling and capitalization errors that make the letter look unprofessional.\n\nOverall, the student's response corresponds largely to score point 3: A minimally-developed response that takes a clear position, but with inadequate support and details, satisfactory organization, and some awareness of audience.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",

The letter details how computers benefit people in terms of communication, education, work, and planning. However, the presented arguments are not always elaborated on fully. For instance, the point about computer usage aiding people in communication with friends and relatives around the world could be expanded with more specific examples or consequences of lacking such a tool. A beneficial impact at different education levels, the importance in maintaining jobs, and an essential role in material learning are presented, but the support of these arguments is not completely convincing and lacks some specific details.\n\nIn terms of organization, the letter is not strongly constructed. The student's ideas are slightly overlapping and repetitive, which hinders the overall flow of the letter. Transitions between points are not smooth, and the writing appears to be more of a stream of consciousness than a carefully organized argument.\n\nFurthermore, the student's response has several spelling and grammar mistakes which somewhat detracts from the readability. However, it does show solid awareness of the audience, considering it addresses issues concerning different age groups and occupations.\n\nOverall, the student's response aligns most closely with the Score Point 4. It takes a position and provides an adequate, albeit inadequate, level of elaboration on the supporting reasons. While organization can be improved and more specific detail on points could be added, it successfully delivers its intended message to the audience.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

        "essay": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",
        "marker": "The student's response reflects a clear position on the topics pertaining to the dangers of excessive technology use. The student utilizes social networks and email for their argument, pointing out how they invite harmful cyberbullying and online predators, thereby putting the youth in danger. \n\nThe response goes a step further by incorporating specific (though vague) examples to support their claims, such as the story of a student (referred to as \"@PERSON1\") from \"@ORGANIZATION1\" who was a victim of cyberbullying. However, the student doesn't provide specific details and names, which is likely to be placeholders, making the response less compelling. An actual name and organization would have offered a more robust argument and specific, concrete evidence to back up the claim. \n\nThe student also links the overuse of computers to health issues such as obesity in children, providing statistics on the percentage of the day that children spend in front of computers. This argument is well-presented, but again, the lack of proper citation of the data sources makes the credibility of the information questionable. \n\nThe organization and structure of the response are satisfactory, with each paragraph essentially dealing with a different point and building up the argument neatly. This clarity in structure aids the overall readability of the response.\n\nThe letter ends with a call to action, appealing to readers to take a stand to put halt to the identified problems, effectively demonstrating the intended persuasiveness of the argument.\n\nThe student exhibits moderate fluency and reasonably adequate transitional language. Some use of emotion (\"I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\") indicates an effort to engage with the audience on a personal level, demonstrating an adequate awareness of the audience.\n\nBased on the criteria in the rubric, considering this response's clear position, general organization and structure, specifics and examples utilized (though diminished in value due to lack of actual referencing, which I am reading as placeholders), reasonable fluency and the turnout of argument, I'd say this falls within a score point 4. It's somewhat developed and adequately supported, with suitable structure and some evidence of transitional language, but could be better with more compelling, real life examples and citations.\n\nSCORE: 4/6.",

        "marker": "Review:\n\nThe student's answer does not clearly identify the mood created by the author in the memoir or offer a detailed explanation to support the single mood - love - that they mention. The answer only briefly mentions Narciso Rodriguez's (presented as female in the student's answer) appreciation of his Cuban background and the environment he grew up in. However, this does not fully capture the complex mood created by the author in the memoir.\n\nFor a better response, the student could have identified multiple moods such as nostalgia, gratitude, and warmth created by the author. For instance, the author nostalgically talks about his growing up years, his intimate relationship with his parents, and the cultural richness of his home - all done out of a sense of gratitude. The memoir also presents a mood of warmth in how it describes the togetherness of different cultures within the neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to this, the student appears to have mistook the author's gender throughout the response, alongside fragmented sentences that reduces the clarity of the response. Detailed, specific references to the memoir are lacking which could strongly express the mood(s) created by the author.\n\nGiven these points, the student's answer necessitates significant improvement to acquire a higher score. According to the rubric, it does not meet the requirements for a clear and complete description of the mood and lacks relevant, specific information from the memoir.\n\nFinal Score:\n\nBased on the rubric, the student's response earns a Score Point 1 as it only provides a minimal description of the mood and fails to incorporate significant information from the memoir.

However, the response is missing other key obstacles, such as the problem of existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas and the constantly shifting winds due to violent air currents, which are significant details provided in the excerpt. Additionally, the student's prose, while understandable and correctly addressing the prompt, is somewhat disorganized and contains a few grammatical errors. However, overall, the student's answer does demonstrate comprehension of the material.\n\nThe student's response matches the rubric's description for a score point 2. \n\nRationale:\n\nThe student's answer provides a partial description of the obstacles, including the use of flammable hydrogen and the impracticality of anchoring dirigibles high above city streets. While these points are correct, the response is missing other vital information from the excerpt. The submission includes limited information, and could have been improved by including additional obstacles mentioned in the text.\n\nSCORE: 2/4",

The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

The student explained the structural challenge of incorporating a mooring mast, including the need to modify the building's steel frame to account for the stress on the building. They also detailed the risk associated with dirigibles being filled with flammable hydrogen, referenced the Hindenburg disaster, and emphasized that the dense urban area around the Empire State Building would make a similar accident much worse. Lastly, the student pointed out the natural obstacle of strong and variable winds at the building's altitude. They illustrated how these winds would cause docked dirigibles to swivel and how the typical solution, lead weights, would not be suitable above busy streets.\n\nHowever, the student overlooked one significant obstacle mentioned in the passage. The student didn't mention the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. This is an essential point because it legally hindered the builders' intent.\n\nRationale for Grading:\n\nBased on the rubric given, which requires a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles as well as the incorporation of relevant and specific information from the excerpt, the student's answer should be given a score of 3 out of 4.

Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.

There seems to be a lost opportunity to explore deeper into the emotions or thoughts that contributed to the feeling of impatience and how these were managed. As such, the ideas are somewhat focused on the topic, but are lacking in specific details, hence a score of 4 is given.\n\nIn the category of organization, the connections between ideas and/or events are logically sequenced, but clarity is somewhat lost due to the awkward phrasing and the repeated use of the \"??\" symbols, which make it difficult to understand the precise timeline of events. Therefore, a score of 2 is suitable.\n\nRegarding style, the student uses limited language and expressions that marginally capture the patient experience. The sentence structure is quite simple with little variety and some parts of the story could benefit from more vivid descriptions or emotionally charged language. Thus, the student\u2019s response seems to only adequately support the writer's purpose and audience, warranting a score of 2.\n\nIn terms of conventions, there are several errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation. For example, the questionable use of \"@CAPS1\" and \"??\" signals, the incorrectly formed contractions such as \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d, along with missing punctuation and some awkward phrasing contribute to the errors. It implies a limited understanding of Standard English conventions appropriate for their grade level, hence a score of 1 is assigned.\n\nScore: 4 (Ideas) + 2 (Organization) + 2 (Style) + 1 (Conventions) = SCORE: 9/15",

        "marker": "Ideas:\nThe student does stick to the topic of 'patience.' However, there are areas within the essay that are hard to comprehend due to lack of specific information, mentions of \"@CAPS2\" and \"@CAPS6\" serve as placeholders rather than providing solid context. The story is generally underdeveloped and doesn't fully demonstrate the importance of patience. The student touches on the idea, but the surrounding details are too general to illustrate it effectively. So, using the rubric standards, a score of 2 would be suitable for Ideas.\n\nOrganization:\nThe story does follow a logical sequence, starting with an introduction of the importance of patience and moving on to the experience that taught the student the value of this virtue. However, the event's organization is weak, with lacking transition or connections between different parts of the story. According to the rubric, a score of 1 would fit well for Organization.\n\nStyle:\nThe command of language is limited, with a lack of variety in sentence structure and word choice. The writing style does little to support the writer's purpose and does not effectively engage the reader. The rubric calls this a score 1 in Style.\n\nConventions:\nThe response has multiple basic errors in grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. The overall mechanic proficiency of the document inhibits comprehension at some points, and it does not meet the level of grammar and punctuation expected at the grade level. Based on the rubric, this calls for a score of 1 in Conventions.\n\nIn conclusion, the essay could be improved by providing more specific details, stronger organization, enhancing language proficiency, and addressing mechanical errors. The student seems to understand the basics of the task but requires work to meet the complete expectations in all aspects.\n\nSCORE: 5/15.",

        "marker": "Ideas:\nThe student's story is somewhat focused on the topic and contains specific details but overall lacks more profound nuances associated with patience. The story is less about tolerating and enduring difficulties without complaints and more about passing time while waiting in line. However, the story still relates to patience as they had to wait in a long line for a ride. Based on this evaluation, I would give the student a score of 4 in this category. \n\nOrganization\nThe student's answer is organized in a sequential order as they move from the beginning of their waiting experience to the end of it, marking time as an indicator of the sequence. Ideas and events aren't necessarily clearly connected, and while the sequence is logical, its clarity could be improved. For this, they receive a 2.\n\nStyle\nThe student's use of language is adequate. Word choice serves the purpose of the story, and sentences, while lacking variety, are clear. The story could be enhanced with more varied sentence structures and a more compelling language that create a stronger emotional impact on the reader. The score for this category would be 2.\n\nConventions\nIn terms of grammar and spelling, the student makes multiple mistakes. There are several run-on sentences and missing punctuation. The spacing after the commas is inconsistent, and the last word 'patients' should be 'patience'. For these reasons, the student's response does not demonstrate a consistent, appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for their grade level. Therefore, a score of 1 fits for this category.\n\nIn summary, the scores are:\nIdeas: 4/6 \nOrganization: 2/3 \nStyle: 2/3 \nConventions: 1/3 \nSCORE: 9/15",

        "marker": "The student's response does tell a story that is relevant to the topic of patience. The story is about waiting in a long line for a roller coaster, during which the student encourages their friends to be patient. The story contains specific details like the location and the duration of the wait. However, at the beginning of the text, there are some distracting, inappropriate words (\"Yay! Yag!\") and repeated text from the question, which are not related to the story. Therefore, the story is somewhat focused on the topic rather than clearly focused on the topic. According to the rubric, this corresponds to a score of 4 for Ideas.\n\nIn terms of Organization, the story follows a clear, logical sequence from arriving at the amusement park, seeing the roller coaster, joining the line, waiting, and finally going on the ride. The connections between the events are clear. Consequently, the student should receive a 3 in this category.\n\nFor Style, the student does use effective language to tell their story with some variety in sentence structure, although a few phrases come off as a bit informal for a school essay (\"OMG! Look at those big roller coasters.\"). Additionally, the text could benefit from a wider variety of word choice. Based on the rubric, the student should receive a 2 for Style.\n\nRegarding Conventions, there are a few instances of incorrect grammar and punctuation. For example, \"Somebody that\u2019s patient experiences difficulties without complaining.\" should be \"Somebody who's patient experiences difficulties without complaining.\", and \"The highest and fastest roller coaster there well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds.\" should be \"The highest and fastest roller coaster there... well, it only lasted @NUM1 seconds.\". Therefore, the student earns a 2 for Conventions.\n\nOverall, the student completed the assignment and demonstrated understanding of the concept of patience through a relatable story, but commited several grammatical mistakes and the ideas were only somewhat focused on the topic.\n\nSCORE: 11/15",

The student provides multiple, specific details about their patience, such as waiting for service in a restaurant and not complaining, waiting for their order, requesting for bread, and eventually complaining to the manager only after a long time of patiently waiting. Therefore, the student's ideas score 6.\n\nOrganization\nThe student's story is logically sequenced from the start of the plane ride to the ordeal at the restaurant. There is clear organization and connection between ideas and events in their story about a time when they were patient, which merits a score of 3.\n\nStyle\nThe student displays an adequate command of language with clear sentences, although word choice could be more varied and compelling. The student's style supports their purpose and audience. They score 2 in this category. \n\nConventions\nThe student's response uses conventions of Standard English appropriately for the most part, including grammar, usage, spelling, and punctuation. However, there are minor issues, such as missing spaces and a word that is misspelled - \"dissappered\" instead of \"disappeared\". Because the issues are minor and don't greatly interfere with understanding, the score for conventions is 2.\n\nIn summation, the evaluation of the student's response to the question, keeping in mind the rubric given, is as follows: a score of 6 for ideas; 3 for organization; 2 for style; and 2 for conventions.\n\nSCORE: 13/15",

The story becomes unclear with the unfocused communication between characters. Therefore, a 4 is awarded as the response contains a mix of specific and general details which are loosely tied to theme of patience.\n\nIn terms of organization, connections between events and characters in the story are weak; the dialogue is confusing and it is difficult to discern the true focus of the story's plot. It seems like the student started to go in the direction of being patient while trying to ride a bike and then got lost in the dialogue. The score for this section would be 1.\n\nRegarding style, the use of language is limited; there is repetition and variety in word choice and sentences is lacking which hinders support for the student's purpose and audience. The scoring here would be a 1.\n\nThe final category to consider is conventions. The work is riddled with a handful of errors with capitalization, punctuation, usage and spelling. Entire sentences are improperly capitalized, language use is random and punctuation is misused. Therefore, the student's answer receives a 0 in the conventions section.\n\nTo sum up, the student's answer scores 4 for ideas, 1 for organization, 1 for style and 0 for conventions. This gives a total score of 6/15. Although the student attempted to tell a story tied to the theme of patience, improvements in clarity, focus, language use and adherence to standard English grammar and spelling rules would significantly elevate the quality of the work.\n\nOverall score: 6/15.",

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",
        "marker": "Evaluation:\n\nIdeas: The student attempted to tell a story about patience through the lens of their experience of waiting to play a video game with their brothers. While they did touch upon the theme, there is a lack of thematic and emotional depth in the detailing. They did, however, manage to give an example from their life where they were made to showcase patience. Therefore, the arguments presented are somewhat focused and developed with a mix of specific and general details. Hence, a score of 4 would be appropriate.\n\nOrganization: The story was organized in a logical sequence. The student introduced the concept of patience, explained their relationship with it, gave a specific anecdote, talked about their emotions during the waiting period, and ended on the note how being patient paid off. Hence, a score of 3 would be suitable.\n\nStyle: The language used is casual and conversational, which is suitable for the kind of anecdote the student is sharing. There are, however, a few instances of incorrect grammar and sentence formation that could have been improved to better support the writer's purpose and audience. An adequate command of language, including word choice and sentence structure is seen here. Score 2 is apt.\n\nConventions: There were several errors in the usage of Standard English conventions. The student occasionally misspelled words (such as \"patience\" and \"pretty\") and used inconsistent punctuation. Instead of increasing clarity and coherence, these irregularities made the story more difficult to follow and decreased the professionalism of the text. Therefore, a score of 1 is assigned.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",

        "essay": "I\u0092m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I\u0092m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",
        "marker": "Ideas: The student tells a story that is somewhat focused on the topic of patience. While the main character's mother indicates that applying makeup requires patience, the story does not thoroughly explore this concept or fully illustrate the patience required. Further, the symbolic importance of patience in this context is discussed rather late, and should have been more integral throughout (Score 4).\n\nOrganization: The story has a clear, sequential structure. The events start with the motivation to learn makeup application, transition to buying makeup, and concludes with the first trial and thoughts on the process. The connections between the ideas are logically sequenced so it gets (Score 3).\n\nStyle: The student's command of language is limited with a few errors in sentence structure and a few confusing word choices. For instance, the use of the placeholder \"@CAPS\" is distracting and hinders meaning. While they do while narrative style, their work lacks variety in sentence structure and word choice, impacting the support for their purpose and audience (Score 1).\n\nConventions: The student makes several grammatical errors and incorrect spellings. Words are consistently capitalized incorrectly and several punctuation errors are evident. This suggests a limited use of conventions of standard English for the grade level (Score 1).\n\nTotal: 4 (Ideas) + 3 (Organization) + 1 (Style) + 1 (Conventions) = 9. \n\nSCORE: 9/15",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": "Evaluation:\n\n1. Ideas: The student\u2019s story follows the given task, telling a personal narrative about a time when they displayed patience with their younger brother. The idea is focused on the topic and is developed with relevant and specific details, making it easy to understand the story and the relation to patience. However, the transition from setting up the scene to the revelation of the main event feels a bit abrupt. The expression of patience could have been more thoroughly developed. Therefore, I'm willing to give it a score of 5 out of 6.\n\n2. Organization: The student presents a clear sequence of events with the introduction of a family gathering, the problem of the younger brother not being able to catch the football, their attempts to teach him, and finally the success. The connection between the actions and the theme of patience is logically built and clearly indicated. The organization is clear with the layout of the events. Thus, I give it a score of 3 out of 3.\n\n3. Style: The student uses a conversational style, which is effective in conveying the story and making it relatable. The sentence structure varies, adding to the readability of the story. The word choice is mostly effective, though some phrases could have been more compelling. Therefore, I give it a score of 2 out of 3.\n\n4. Conventions: Spelling and punctuation seem to be accurate overall, and the capitalization is consistent as well. There are some minor problems with grammar and usage, which include some tense errors (e.g., \"was really alod\" instead of \"was really glad\", \"had token\" instead of \"had taken\", \"@CAPS2\" hasn't been replaced with proper wording) . Therefore, I give it a score of 2 out of 3.\n\nOverall the student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and displays fairly good skills in story-telling. The weaknesses in style and conventions pull the score down a little.\n\nSCORE: 12/15",
