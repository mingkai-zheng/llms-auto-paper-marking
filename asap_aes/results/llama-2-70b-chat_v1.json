Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop.\"\n\nFirstly, the response does not take a clear position on the issue of whether computers benefit society. The student mentions that computers are good for communication and job searching, but also notes that some people spend too much time on them, without fully elaborating on the impact of this. Therefore, I would score this response as a 2, as it provides minimal support for the student's vague position.\n\nThe response is also under-developed, with only a few general reasons and unelaborated details. There is no evidence of organization, and the writing is somewhat awkward and fragmented. The student does not show any awareness of the audience, and the response is difficult to read and understand.\n\nTo improve, the student could have taken a clearer position on the issue and provided more specific details and examples to support their argument. They could have also organized their thoughts and ideas more coherently, and considered the audience they are writing for.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

They jump between different ideas without connecting them logically, and their sentences are often incomplete or run-on. The student's use of transitions is minimal, which makes the response feel disjointed and hard to understand.\n\nOverall, the student's response scores a 2 out of 6. While they attempt to take a position and provide some reasons, their response is underdeveloped, poorly organized, and difficult to read. The student shows little awareness of their audience and fails to provide persuasive support for their claims.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

Say you don\u0092@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer.

Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.",
        "marker": " The student's response provides some details and reasons to support their opinion on the usefulness of computers, but there are several areas that could be improved upon.\n\nFirstly, the response lacks a clear introduction that sets up the topic and the writer's position. Instead, the writer jumps straight into a list of ways that computers are helpful, without providing any context or background information. This lack of introduction makes it difficult for the reader to understand the purpose of the letter and the writer's stance.\n\nSecondly, the response could benefit from more specific and detailed examples. While the writer provides some examples of how computers can be useful, such as online shopping and chatting, they are not elaborated upon in any depth. Additionally, the examples given are not particularly persuasive, as they are not linked to any broader benefits or impacts on society.\n\nThirdly, the response lacks organization. The writer jumps between different topics, such as online shopping, chatting, and watching sports games, without any clear structure or transitions. This makes the response difficult to follow and understand.\n\nFourthly, the response could benefit from more sophisticated language and transitional phrases. The writer uses simple language and sentence structures throughout the response, which detracts from the overall quality of the letter. Additionally, there are no transitional phrases or sentences that connect the different ideas or paragraphs, which makes the response feel disjointed.\n\nLastly, the response could benefit from a more thoughtful and nuanced position on the impact of computers on society. While the writer argues that computers are helpful, they do not acknowledge any potential drawbacks or negative impacts. A more developed response would consider both the benefits and drawbacks of computers and provide a more balanced perspective.\n\nGiven these areas for improvement, I would score the response as follows:\n\nSCORE: 2/6\n\nThe response provides some minimal details and reasons to support the writer's position, but it lacks organization, sophisticated language, and a nuanced perspective on the impact of computers on society.",

Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder.

        "marker": " The student's response is quite disconcerting, as it contains several grammatical errors, incoherent ideas, and a lack of cohesive structure.\n\nFirstly, the response lacks a clear introduction that sets the tone for the rest of the letter. Instead, the student dives straight into their argument without addressing the reader or providing any context. This lack of clarity makes it difficult for the reader to understand the author's purpose and stance on the topic.\n\nFurthermore, the response is filled with inappropriate language and tone. For instance, the author uses the phrase \"people are so fat\" and \"they spend too much time on computers and less time exercising.\" This type of language is not only offensive, but it also undermines the author's credibility and distracts from their argument.\n\nIn addition, the response contains factual errors and lacks evidence to support the author's claims. For instance, the author states that \"computers are bad\" and that \"people die each year of being overweight,\" but they do not provide any data or research to back up these assertions. This lack of evidence weakens the author's argument and makes it challenging for the reader to take their claims seriously.\n\nMoreover, the response lacks transitional phrases and cohesive structure. The author jumps from one idea to another without connecting them logically, making it arduous for the reader to follow their train of thought. This lack of cohesion also detracts from the author's argument and makes the response harder to comprehend.\n\nLastly, the response does not address the reader and does not consider their perspective. The author writes in a confrontational tone, which may alienate the reader and undermine the author's purpose.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response a 2 out of 6. The response shows minimal development and inadequate support for the author's claims. The writing is awkward, confused, and difficult to read, with little awareness of the audience. While the author takes a position, they offer only general reasons with minimal elaboration and no persuasive details.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it.

        "marker": " The student's response to the prompt is a letter to the editor that argues in favor of the benefits of computers for society. The letter presents several points that support the idea that computers have a positive impact on people's lives. However, the response could be improved in several areas, which will be discussed below.\n\n1. The introduction does not grab the reader's attention and does not provide a clear thesis statement that sets the tone for the rest of the letter. Instead, it simply states that computers are a good thing without providing any explanation or context.\n2. The first point the student makes is that computers allow people to communicate with others through video chat and messaging. This is a valid point, but it could be developed further. The student could have provided examples of how video chat has helped people stay in touch with loved ones who live far away, or how it has facilitated communication between people from different cultures. Instead, the point is left somewhat vague and lacks specific details.\n3. The second point the student makes is that computers can be useful in emergency situations. However, this point is not well-developed. The student mentions that computers can be used to email people in emergency situations, but this is not a clear or convincing example. A better example would be explaining how computers can be used to access important information or resources during a natural disaster or other emergency.\n4. The third point the student makes is that computers can help people manage their finances and pay bills. This is a good point, but again, it could be developed further. The student could have explained how computers have made it easier for people to pay bills online, or how they have helped people keep track of their finances and avoid debt.\n5. The conclusion is weak and does not summarize the main points made in the letter. Instead, it simply reiterates the idea that computers are a good thing without providing any additional insight or persuasive language.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would give this response a score of 3. The response takes a position and provides some support, but it lacks development and detail. The organization is somewhat awkward, and the writing is not always clear or concise. There are some attempts at transitional language, but they are not always effective. The response does not show a consistent awareness of the audience, and the tone is not persuasive.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": " The student's response to the prompt is a letter to the editor expressing their opinion on the negative effects of computer usage on people. The response is somewhat developed, but there are areas that could be improved upon.\n\nThe response starts by stating the main argument that computer usage has a negative effect on people, specifically in terms of exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. However, the introduction could be stronger and more engaging. The student could have started with a hook that grabs the reader's attention and makes them want to read more. Additionally, the thesis statement could be more specific and directly address the opposing viewpoints.\n\nThe first body paragraph discusses the lack of exercise due to computer usage. The student provides some specific examples, such as not having time to go for a walk or play sports. However, this paragraph could be improved by providing more detailed and personalized examples. Instead of using general statements, the student could have shared a personal experience of how they had to choose between playing a game and going for a walk, and how they regret the decision to choose the former.\n\nThe second body paragraph talks about the lack of time to enjoy nature. The student provides a hypothetical scenario of someone wanting to go for a nature walk but not having the time. However, this scenario could be more effective if it were more detailed and relatable. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific examples of how computer usage has affected their own ability to enjoy nature.\n\nThe third body paragraph discusses the impact of computer usage on social interactions. The student argues that people are spending less time with their family and friends because of computer usage. However, this paragraph could be improved by providing more specific examples and elaborating on how this has affected the student's own relationships.\n\nThe conclusion could be stronger and more persuasive. Instead of simply summarizing the main points, the student could have ended with a call to action, urging readers to take action and reduce their computer usage.\n\nOrganization:\nThe response has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, the transitions between paragraphs could be improved. The student could have used transitional phrases and sentences to connect the paragraphs and make the response flow better.\n\nAudience awareness:\nThe student shows some awareness of the audience by using a casual tone and addressing the readers directly. However, the response could be more tailored to the audience's interests and concerns. The student could have used specific examples that resonate with the readers' experiences and values.\n\nievement:\nThe student has addressed most of the requirements of the prompt, but could have gone further in elaborating on their points and providing more specific examples. Additionally, some sentences are awkward and difficult to understand, indicating a need for more attention to sentence-level clarity.\n\nScore: 3.5/6\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a good effort to address the prompt, but could benefit from more attention to detail and persuasive techniques.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe.

        "marker": " The student's response is a letter to the editor that argues in favor of the benefits of computers for society. The response is somewhat organized and has some good points, but it also has some areas that need improvement.\n\nFirstly, the response does not take a clear position in the introduction, and the thesis statement is not explicit. The student mentions that computers are beneficial, but does not specify why or how they benefit society. This lack of clarity makes it difficult for the reader to understand the author's main argument.\n\nFurthermore, the response has minimal elaboration and depends mostly on generic details. The student mentions that computers provide access to information, enable communication, and organization, but does not offer specific examples or explanations to support these claims. The details provided are also rather simplified and lack depth. For instance, the student states that computers make exercising easier by providing access to fitness sites, but does not explain how or why this is the case.\n\nAdditionally, the response shows little awareness of the audience. The student does not consider the potential counterarguments or doubts that the reader might have, and does not offer any evidence or statistics to support their claims. There is also a lack of transitions between ideas, which makes the response seem disjointed and difficult to follow.\n\nHowever, the response is not entirely underdeveloped. The student has attempted to address some of the prompt requirements, such as discussing the benefits of computers for communication and organization. There is also some attempt at using persuasive language, such as when the student describes computers as \"beneficial to our society.\"\n\nOverall, I would score this response as a 2 out of 6. While there are some areas that need improvement, such as the lack of a clear thesis statement, minimal elaboration, and little audience awareness, the response does show some attempt at addressing the prompt and using persuasive language.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": " The student's response is a letter to the editor that argues in favor of the positive effects of computers on people. The letter presents several reasons to support this position, including the ability to access information, communicate with others, and learn new skills. However, the response could be improved in several areas, particularly in terms of organization, elaboration, and persuasiveness.\n\nOrganization: The response lacks a clear introduction that sets up the argument and grabs the reader's attention. Instead, it dives directly into the reasons why computers are beneficial. Additionally, the letter jumps abruptly from discussing the benefits of computers for education to their usefulness for long-distance communication, without much of a transition. To improve the organization, the student could have started with a brief introduction that introduces the topic and outlines the main points of the argument. Then, each paragraph could focus on one main idea, such as education, communication, or skill development, and transition smoothly into the next paragraph.\n\nElaboration: While the response provides some specific examples and details to support the argument, they are often vague or lack specificity. For instance, the student mentions that computers can help people learn new skills, but does not expand on what those skills might be or how they can be applied in real life. To improve elaboration, the student could have provided more concrete examples of how computers have positively impacted people's lives, such as describing a specific educational program or online resource that has helped them learn a new skill.\n\nPersuasiveness: The response could be more persuasive if it addressed counterarguments and provided more compelling evidence to support its claims. For example, the student could have acknowledged potential concerns about excessive screen time or the digital divide, and then presented evidence to refute those concerns. Additionally, the response could benefit from more passionate language and rhetorical devices to make the argument more engaging and memorable.\n\nAudience awareness: The response does not demonstrate a strong awareness of the audience, as it does not address the reader directly or consider their potential concerns or interests. To improve audience awareness, the student could have used more inclusive language, such as \"we\" and \"our,\" to engage the reader and make them feel invested in the argument.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\n* Score Point 3: A minimally-developed response that takes a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe response shows some organization, but it is not well-developed, and the elaboration is minimal.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me.

Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer.

These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

The student provides a brief personal experience related to being a patient, but the narrative is minimal and lacks specific details.

The sentence structure is simple, with a lack of variety in word choice and sentence structure.

I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas (Score 4/6):\nThe student's story is focused on the topic of patience, and they provide several specific details that support their idea. They describe a sunny day, their family members' activities, and their attempts to teach their younger brother how to catch a football. However, the story lacks some depth and complexity. For example, the student could have explored the emotions they felt during the process or reflected on what they learned from the experience. Additionally, the story doesn't fully demonstrate the importance of patience or how it can be applied to other situations.\n\nOrganization (Score 3/3):\nThe student's story is well-organized and easy to follow. They use transitional phrases to connect their ideas and events, and the story flows logically. However, the student could have used more descriptive language to make the story more engaging and interesting.\n\nStyle (Score 2/3):\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but it doesn't particularly stand out. They use simple sentence structures and vocabulary, which makes the story feel a bit flat. The student could have used more varied sentence structures, descriptive adjectives, and vivid verbs to make their writing more engaging and effective.\n\nConventions (Score 3/3):\nThe student's use of conventions is consistent and appropriate for their grade level. They use proper grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation throughout their response.\n\nSCORE: 12/15\n\nRationale:\nThe student's response demonstrates some strengths, such as a clear organization and appropriate use of conventions. However, their ideas could be more developed and sophisticated, and their use of language could be more varied and engaging. Overall, the student's response is satisfactory, but it has room for improvement in terms of depth, complexity, and style.",
