You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "marker": "Step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\n1. Introduction:\nThe student starts with a brief acknowledgement of the concerns about computers and states their opinion that computers are positive. However, the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement that clearly expresses the student's opinion on the effects of computers on people. The introduction could have been stronger and more focused.\n\n2. Body paragraph 1:\nThe first body paragraph discusses how computers teach hand-eye coordination. The student mentions that there are fun games online that can improve reflexes and eyesight. However, there is no elaboration or specific examples provided. The point about computers helping to improve reflexes and eyesight is too generalized and lacks depth.\n\n3. Body paragraph 2:\nThe second body paragraph focuses on how computers help people learn about faraway places and people. The student mentions that computers allow you to look up information about distant locations and feel like you are really there. While the idea is conveyed, there is little elaboration or specific examples provided. The paragraph could have been more persuasive and convincing with the inclusion of specific instances or experiences.\n\n4. Body paragraph 3:\nThe third body paragraph discusses how computers allow people to talk with family and friends online. The student states that there are various websites to communicate with loved ones. However, this point is also underdeveloped, lacking specific examples or explanations of how this benefits society. The paragraph could also have addressed potential counterarguments or concerns, adding more depth to the argument.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThe conclusion briefly restates the main points from the body paragraphs and reiterates the student's overall opinion that computers are helpful and necessary. However, the conclusion lacks power and does not leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nRationale for the assigned score:\n\nBased on the rubric provided, I would assign this response a score of 3. The response is minimally-developed and offers reasons with minimal elaboration and more general than specific details. Although there is some attempt at organization within the body paragraphs, the writing is awkward in parts and lacks fluidity. The response shows some awareness of the audience, but the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion could have been more persuasive and compelling. Overall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic, but lacks depth, specificity, and strong support for the stated opinion.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

For example, @CAPS2 a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what.

The reason why I think we should use computers is that if we need help on something, we can find it on the computer. For example, if a student needs help with homework, they can go on Google and find resources that will assist them. There are also websites like http.historywork.com that provide helpful information. This shows that computers can be a valuable resource for educational support.\n\nAnother reason why I believe we should use computers is because sometimes it is the only way to get in touch with someone. If you have an email account or are on social media platforms like Gmail, Facebook, Yahoo, or Myspace, you can easily communicate with your friends. I personally use these platforms frequently to communicate with my friends. This demonstrates the convenience and connectivity that computers offer.\n\nLastly, computers are helpful when we have important messages or notifications on websites. For example, if you receive an urgent message on a website, checking your computer is the quickest way to access it and respond. I often use this method and find it efficient. This highlights the importance of computers for effective communication and staying informed.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have a positive impact on people. They provide educational support, facilitate communication, and ensure that important messages are received and addressed promptly. Computers are an essential tool in today's technologically advanced society.\n\nSincerely,\n[Student's Name]\n\nRationale:\n\nThe student's response demonstrates some effort in expressing their opinion on the effects of computers.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

They argue that computers offer knowledge and communication and emphasize the positive impact it has on people.\n\n3.

This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point. Thats why computers are so convienient. So now you have read how helpful, how its a neccessity, and the computer is convienient. Now one day if you need one of these things remember this and check out the hottest sites on the @CAPS15.",
        "marker": "Step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\n1. Introduction:\nThe student begins the letter by asking a rhetorical question about whether computers are handy and says that they believe computers are handy. While this addresses the prompt of stating the student's opinion on the effects of computers, it lacks a clear thesis statement or overall argument.\n\n2. Body paragraphs:\na. Online shopping:\nThe student mentions online shopping as a benefit of computers. They explain that online shopping can be helpful for people who do not have a car and can order items online. They mention items like clothes, shoes, and games that can be bought online. However, the explanation is very brief and lacks specific details or examples to support their argument. There are also grammatical errors and confusion in the sentence structure, making the explanation difficult to understand.\n\nb. Chatting on the computer:\nThe student talks about the popularity of chatting on social networking sites like Facebook. They mention following famous people and using webcams for online communication. Again, the explanation is very brief and lacks specific details or examples. The sentence structure is unclear and there are grammatical errors, making it difficult to understand the point the student is trying to make.\n\nc. Watching sports online:\nThe student mentions that watching live sports games from a computer is convenient, especially when on a long road trip. They mention specific websites where sports games can be watched. However, just like the previous paragraphs, the explanation lacks specific details or examples and is difficult to understand due to grammatical errors and unclear sentence structure.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nThe student concludes the letter by summarizing their points about the helpfulness, necessity, and convenience of computers. However, the conclusion does not effectively persuade the readers to agree with the student's opinion.\n\nOverall, the student's response lacks development, support, and clarity. The ideas are presented in a disorganized and fragmented manner, making it difficult to follow and understand the argument. The response also shows minimal awareness of the audience, as the language and grammar errors hinder readability. Additionally, the response does not provide sufficient and persuasive reasons to support the student's opinion.\n\nRationale for the grade:\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would award this response a Score Point 1. The response is undeveloped, contains few details, is awkward and fragmented, and is difficult to read and understand. It does not show awareness of the audience. While the student attempts to state their opinion on the effects of computers, the lack of specific support and coherence in their arguments prevent them from persuading the readers to agree with their viewpoint.\n\nSCORE: 1/6",

Contains few or vague details: The student's response lacks specific details to support their argument. They mention the issue of obesity but provide no evidence or statistics to back up their claim. They also mention the negative impact of computers on nature and animal torture, but do not provide any examples or elaboration.\n\n2.

May be difficult to read and understand: As mentioned above, the numerous errors and lack of organization make the response challenging to comprehend. The lack of clear structure and coherence further contributes to the difficulty in understanding the student's argument.\n\n4.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "Step-by-step review:\n\n1. Introduction: The student begins the letter by stating their opinion that computers are bad for society. However, the introduction lacks a clear thesis statement and does not effectively grab the reader's attention. The introduction could be more engaging and persuasive.\n\n2. Body Paragraph 1: The student argues that computers can lead to obesity because people spend too much time on them instead of exercising. However, the argument is weak and lacks supporting evidence. The example of a kid playing on the computer and gaining weight is not convincing enough. Additionally, the paragraph lacks organization and coherence.\n\n3. Body Paragraph 2: The student discusses the issue of cramps that can occur from excessive computer use. However, the paragraph is poorly developed and lacks clear supporting details. The reasoning is also unclear and confusing. The paragraph needs more elaboration to effectively make the point.\n\n4. Body Paragraph 3: The student brings up the issue of sexual harassment that can occur online. However, the paragraph is not well-developed and lacks specific examples or evidence. The reasoning is weak and the argument does not flow logically. The paragraph needs more support to strengthen the argument.\n\n5. Body Paragraph 4: The student discusses cyberbullying as a negative effect of computers. However, the paragraph is poorly structured and lacks clear reasoning. The example given about children becoming poor or sick due to cyberbullying is not well-explained or supported. The paragraph needs better organization and more specific details.\n\n6.

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",
        "marker": "The student's response is a slightly under-developed response. It contains three main reasons to support the effects of computers on people: communication, ways of helping people, and managing money and bills. However, the details provided for each reason are minimal and lack specificity.\n\nIn the first paragraph, the student discusses the ability to communicate with people online using video chat and social media. However, the details are vague and lack clarity. The student mentions that there is a thing called \"vidio chat\" and that it allows people to talk to others around the world. The student also mentions a thing called \"@CAPS1\" but fails to explain or clarify what it is or how it helps people communicate. The lack of specific details and explanations diminishes the persuasive power of this reason.\n\nIn the second paragraph, the student discusses the ways that computers can help people in emergencies. The student mentions that one can save emergency contact information on a computer, but fails to further elaborate or provide specific examples of how this would be helpful in an emergency. The mention of an email being used to contact someone in an emergency is also unclear and lacks sufficient explanation.\n\nIn the third paragraph, the student discusses the ability of computers to help people manage their money and bills. However, the details provided are minimal. The student mentions that a certain percentage of people pay their bills and manage their money on the computer but does not provide any further explanation or examples. The connection between managing money and having a computer is not well established.\n\nThe overall organization of the response is also lacking. The paragraphs feel disjointed and there is no clear progression of ideas from one paragraph to the next. Additionally, the response is full of grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that make it challenging to comprehend the intended meaning.\n\nConsidering the rubric, this response aligns with Score Point 2: An under-developed response that may or may not take a position. It contains only general reasons with unelaborated and/or list-like details. It shows little or no evidence of organization and may be awkward and confused or simplistic. It also shows little awareness of the audience.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information.

        "marker": "The student's response reflects an attempt to address the question and provide their opinion on the effects computers have on people. However, the response is significantly flawed in various aspects, resulting in an overall weak and underdeveloped argument.\n\nFirstly, the student lacks coherence and organization throughout the letter. The ideas jump from one point to another without clear transitions or logical flow. This lack of organization makes it difficult to follow the student's argument and weakens the overall persuasiveness of the letter (Score Point 2).\n\nSecondly, the response contains several sentence structure errors and misspellings, which impede understanding and readability. These errors make it challenging to comprehend the student's intended message and detract from the clarity of their argument (Score Point 1).\n\nRegarding the content of the letter, the student provides some reasons to support their opinion but fails to develop and support them adequately. For example, they mention that computers allow people to learn about faraway places and people, but they provide only a vague reference to Wikipedia and fail to expand on this idea with specific examples or evidence. Similarly, they argue that computers promote exercise and going out to look at nature, but they fail to provide any substantive support or explanation for this claim (Score Point 2).\n\nFurthermore, the response includes several unsupported assertions, such as the claim that computers make everything easier without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this statement. These unsupported assertions weaken the persuasiveness of the letter and demonstrate a lack of effective argumentation (Score Point 2).\n\nIn terms of audience awareness, the response does not show a strong understanding of the target readership. The student addresses the newspaper as \"Newspaper,\" which is a generic and impersonal salutation. Additionally, the lack of consideration for the newspaper's perspective or potential counterarguments suggests a limited awareness of the audience (Score Point 1).\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response is weak and underdeveloped, lacking coherence, organization, supported reasoning, and awareness of the audience. The numerous sentence structure errors and misspellings further detract from the clarity and impact of the student's argument. Based on the rubric, I would assign this response a SCORE: 1/6.",

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",

The introduction of the letter provides some background information about the debate on the effects of computers on people but does not clearly state the writer's opinion. The introduction is also riddled with spelling and grammar errors.\n\n2. The first paragraph presents some reasons why computers have a positive effect on people, such as providing access to needed information, enabling communication with friends and family around the world, and helping in learning new things. However, the details provided are vague and not well-elaborated. The paragraph lacks organization and coherence.\n\n3. The second paragraph attempts to provide further support for the positive effects of computers by mentioning their importance in education and workplace productivity. However, the paragraph is poorly constructed, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The argument presented is fragmented and lacks specific examples or evidence.\n\n4. The third paragraph discusses the ability of computers to facilitate communication with friends and family around the world without incurring additional expenses. Although this point is relevant, the paragraph lacks clarity and cohesiveness. The writing style is disjointed and contains many spelling and grammatical errors.\n\n5. The fourth paragraph attempts to emphasize the role of computers in education and child development but does so in a disjointed and confusing manner. The paragraph lacks structure, making it challenging for readers to understand the intended message.\n\n6. The conclusion restates the writer's opinion that computers have a positive effect on people and briefly summarizes the points made in the letter. However, the conclusion does not present any new information or provide a strong closing argument.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a limited understanding of the task. It lacks organization, coherence, and adequate support. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors throughout the letter, making it difficult to read and understand. The response falls into the Score Point 1 category of the rubric due to its undeveloped nature, minimal details, fragmented structure, and lack of awareness of the audience.\n\nSCORE: 1/6",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",

        "marker": "Student Response:\n\nThere were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.\n\nReview:\n\nThe student's response provides a clear and accurate description of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt, such as the flammability of dirigibles filled with hydrogen, the presence of violent air currents, and the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The response also addresses the three main obstacles mentioned in the question.

Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor.

The lack of engaging word choice and sentence structure limits the effectiveness of the writing in supporting the purpose of the story.\n\nRegarding conventions, the student's use of grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation is generally appropriate for their grade level. However, there are some errors present, such as the use of \"@CAPS\" instead of proper capitalization and misspelled words like \"board\" instead of \"bored\". These errors slightly detract from the overall effectiveness of the writing.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a limited understanding and development of ideas, weak organization, basic language use, and adequate conventions. Based on the rubric, the score for this response would be:\n\nSCORE: 5/15",

        "marker": "Step-by-step review of student's response:\n\n1. Ideas (Score: 4)\nThe student tells a story about a time when they were patient. They mention going to an amusement park with friends and waiting patiently in line for a roller coaster ride. While the story focuses on the topic of patience, the ideas are somewhat scattered and lack thorough development. There is a mix of specific and general details, but they could have provided more specific examples or descriptions to support their ideas.\n\n2. Organization (Score: 1)\nThe organization of the story is weak. The events are loosely connected and there is no clear sequence of events. The student starts by mentioning going to an amusement park, then jumps to packing water bottles and getting into a car, then suddenly mentions seeing roller coasters and waiting in line. The lack of smooth transitions and logical sequence makes it difficult to follow the story.\n\n3. Style (Score: 2)\nThe student demonstrates an adequate command of language with some effective word choice and clear sentences. However, there is limited variety in sentence structure and the language used is not particularly compelling or engaging. The writing lacks creativity and could benefit from more vivid descriptions and details to make the story more interesting.\n\n4. Conventions (Score: 1)\nThe student exhibits limited use of conventions of Standard English. There are several errors in grammar, such as missing articles (\"a\" and \"the\"), incorrect verb tenses (\"called\" instead of \"calling\"), and punctuation errors (missing or misplaced punctuation marks). These errors hinder the clarity and effectiveness of the writing.\n\nOverall, the student's response lacks strong development of ideas, organization, and style, while also containing numerous errors in conventions.\n\nSCORE: 8/15",

The story includes specific details such as the location, the interaction with the woman, and the actions taken by the student. However, the ideas are not consistently focused on the topic of patience. The student mentions being impatient and wanting to help the elderly woman quickly so they can attend to their cousin's arrival. This detracts from the overall idea of patience. Although there are some relevant details, the idea development is minimal. Additionally, the story becomes confusing at times, such as when the woman asks the student to find her purse but only provides change as compensation. This inconsistency weakens the idea development.\n\nScore: 2\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the story is somewhat logical, with events following a sequential order. The story begins with the student encountering the elderly woman, progresses with the student assisting her, and concludes with the student leaving and sharing the story with their mother. However, there are instances of unclear transitions and a lack of clear connection between events. For example, the transition from finding the woman's lost keys to the woman asking the student to find her purse feels abrupt and disjointed.

        "marker": "Evaluation:\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt and includes a story about a time when the student was patient. However, there are several areas for improvement in terms of organization, style, and conventions.\n\nIn terms of ideas, the student's response is minimally focused on the topic. While the story is about the student being patient while waiting for their food at a restaurant, there is limited development of specific and relevant details. The student mentions the time it took for the food to arrive, but there is little exploration of the student's thoughts, feelings, or actions during that time. This lack of development detracts from the overall clarity and depth of the ideas presented. Additionally, the student does not explicitly connect patience to the experience of waiting for their food, which further weakens the development of ideas. Overall, the student's response warrants a score of 2 in the ideas category.\n\nIn terms of organization, the student's response does show some logical sequencing of events. The story begins with the student ordering food and waiting, and concludes with the food finally arriving. However, there is room for improvement in terms of transitions and overall coherence. The student mentions various time intervals without clear transitions, which can make the story feel disjointed. Additionally, the student could have provided more context and background information to help the reader understand the significance of the situation. Although the organization is somewhat logical, these weaknesses result in a score of 2 in this category.\n\nIn terms of style, the student's response demonstrates a limited command of language. The word choice and sentence structure are simple and repetitive, with little variety or creativity. The student primarily relies on basic vocabulary and does not effectively convey the emotions or thoughts associated with waiting patiently. The lack of descriptive language or figurative expressions further inhibits the writer's ability to engage the reader. While the response is clear and understandable, the limited use of language detracts from its effectiveness. Therefore, the student's response merits a score of 1 in the style category.\n\nIn terms of conventions, the student's response demonstrates limited use of conventions of Standard English. There are several errors in grammar, capitalization, and punctuation that hinder the overall clarity and coherence of the writing. For example, the student's use of capitalization is inconsistent, and there are several instances of missing or incorrect punctuation. Additionally, the response contains a spelling error (\"didn\u0092t\") and does not adhere to proper conventions of paragraphing. These errors indicate a need for improvement in the student's understanding and application of standard conventions. As a result, the student's response receives a score of 1 in the conventions category.\n\nSCORE: 6/15",

        "marker": "Step-by-Step Review:\n\nThe student's response starts off with a statement that reflects a lack of interest in being patient. This does not align with the prompt, which asks for a story about a time when the student was patient or someone they know was patient. \n\nMoving on, the student shares a personal experience of having to be patient when waiting for their turn to play video games. They explain that they had to wait for a long time to play a new game that they were excited about while their older brothers monopolized the game console. The student expresses their feelings of sadness and anger but notes that they did not complain. They describe waiting for four hours and eventually getting a chance to play the game. The story concludes with a message about being patient when wanting to do something you really want, as it will eventually pay off.\n\nIdeas: \nThe response earns a score of 4 in this category. While the story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, the student's initial statements about not liking patience and considering it boring are off-topic and irrelevant. However, they do provide a story about a personal experience of having to be patient while waiting for a turn to play video games, which fulfills the task. The story is developed with specific details about the situation and the student's feelings.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization earns a score of 3. The ideas and events are logically sequenced, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The student begins by introducing their dislike for patience, transitions to the specific scenario of waiting for their turn to play the game, and concludes with the message about patience paying off.\n\nStyle:\nThe style earns a score of 2. While the student demonstrates an adequate command of language with an understandable narrative, there is room for improvement in word choice and sentence variety. The language used is simple and could benefit from more descriptive and engaging vocabulary. Additionally, the sentence structure could be more varied for better flow and interest.\n\nConventions:\nThe conventions earn a score of 2. The student generally demonstrates adequate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are some errors present, such as missing punctuation marks and inconsistent capitalization (\"@NUM1,\" \"patiente,\" \"Brothers,\" \"ton,\" \"Bros,\" \"couldn\u0092t,\" \"didn\u0092t,\" \"complained\"). These errors do not significantly hinder understanding, but they do show some lack of attention to detail.\n\nSCORE: 11/15",

I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",
        "marker": "Step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas (Score: 4/6):\nThe student's response tells a story about a time when they were patient with their younger sister. The story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience as it describes the student's interaction with their sister and their attempt to learn to do makeup. The ideas are developed with a mix of specific details, such as the conversation with the mother about makeup, and general details, such as the mention of going shopping for makeup. However, the response lacks thorough development and could benefit from more specific and relevant details to fully illustrate the concept of patience.\n\nOrganization (Score: 2/3):\nThe organization of the response is somewhat coherent and logically sequenced. There is an introduction that sets up the situation, followed by a series of events that describe the interaction with the mother and the trip to buy makeup. The response could have been more organized by using paragraphs to separate different events or ideas. The connection between ideas and events is somewhat clear but could have been strengthened with smoother transitions.\n\nStyle (Score: 2/3):\nThe student shows an adequate command of language with generally clear sentences. However, there are several errors and awkward phrasings throughout the response that hinder the effectiveness of their writing. For example, \"I\u0092m constantly patient moioly\" should be \"I'm constantly patient mainly.\" The student could also benefit from using more varied sentence structures and enhancing their word choice to make the story more compelling and engaging.\n\nConventions (Score: 2/3):\nThe response demonstrates some use of conventions of Standard English, with some errors in grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. For example, there are errors in punctuation, such as missing commas and apostrophes. The student's writing is generally understandable but would benefit from greater attention to detail in following the conventions of Standard English.\n\nOverall, the student's response reflects a partial understanding of the prompt and demonstrates some effort in conveying the idea of patience. However, the response lacks thorough development, has weaknesses in organization, style, and conventions of Standard English.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": "Review:\n\nThe student's response does address the prompt of writing a story about a time when they were patient. The story describes a situation where the student had to patiently teach their little brother how to play catch with a football. They demonstrate patience by repeatedly explaining and helping their brother until he finally catches the ball. Overall, the story provides specific details and shows a clear understanding of what it means to be patient.\n\nIdeas (Score: 4)\nThe ideas in the story are somewhat focused on the topic of patience. The student tells a story about their experience teaching their little brother, but there are some parts of the story that could be more developed or more directly related to the theme of patience. For example, the beginning of the story with the family setting up for a meal could have been connected more clearly to the theme of patience. Additionally, the story could have explored the student's feelings and thoughts about being patient in greater depth.\n\nOrganization (Score: 2)\nThe organization of the story is somewhat logical and sequenced, but there are some areas where the organization could have been improved. The story starts with the family setting up for a meal, then jumps to the student teaching their brother, and ends with the brother catching the ball. While there is a clear sequence of events, the transitions between them could have been smoother. The story could have been more effectively structured to build suspense or emphasize the growth of patience throughout the experience.\n\nStyle (Score: 2)\nThe student demonstrates an adequate command of language, but there are opportunities for improvement in word choice and sentence structure. Some sentences are choppy or repetitive, and there is limited variation in word choice. The style of writing could be enhanced by using more descriptive language to engage the reader and create a stronger sense of the experience.\n\nConventions (Score: 1)\nThe student's use of conventions of Standard English is limited. There are several grammatical errors, such as missing or incorrect punctuation, lack of subject-verb agreement, and inconsistent capitalization. Although some errors are minor, they are frequent enough to impact the clarity and effectiveness of the writing.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the concept of patience and tells a coherent story. However, there are areas where the response could be improved in terms of organization, style, and conventions.\n\nSCORE: 9/15",
