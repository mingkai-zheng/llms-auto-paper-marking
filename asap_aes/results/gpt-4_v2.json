        "marker": "The student's response falls most closely under Score Point 1.\n\nThe response is indeed undeveloped, as seen from the vague details it provides. While the student does suggest that computers are used to communicate with friends and family, and also for job searching, they do not provide any more context or depth to their argument. This is typical of an undeveloped response containing only very minimal or vague details.\n\nThe response also seems fragmented due to the lack of flow and connectivity. It transitions between discussing the benefits of computers to the pitfalls of using computers without any clear demarcation. For instance, the statement \"Some people spend too much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop\" is clumsily articulated, which contributes to the fragmented and awkward nature of the answer. \n\nThe response may also be difficult to read and understand due to the lack of proper sentence structure, punctuation, and transitions between different thoughts.\n\nLastly, the student does not show an understanding of the type of writing needed as they were asked to write a letter to a newspaper, which requires a specific format and a level of formality that was notably lacking in their response. \n\nAs such, this answer receives the lowest grade based on the rubric, reflecting little structure, minimal detail, and a lack of awareness towards the task at hand. Consequently, the student should be encouraged to provide more detail, make use of connective language, and properly address the format of a letter to the newspaper next time around.\n\nSCORE: 1/6",

        "marker": "The student's response is very difficult to read and understand. The sentences are awkward and fragmented, which fit the features of Score Point 1. However, the response does take a position stating that computers are advantageous, which is more than what is normally expected in Score Point 1 responses.\n\nFor details and examples, the student does mention a number of uses for computers such as \"holiday and birthday cards\", \"Pay bills\", \"book a hotel online\", \"play online games\", \"bidding on ebay, amazon\" and \"chatting online\" among others. They're all broad and general. Though this doesn't quite meet the specificity required for higher points, it\u2019s more than the 'few or vague details' characteristic of Score Point 1.\n\nThe paper lacks proper organization, with sentence structures being chaotic and containing no transition words or phrases linking ideas together, aligning with Score Point 1's 'awkward and fragmented' feature.\n\nThe letter shows very little awareness of the audience. It is not written with clear pronouns and readability in mind. This is problematic as it falls into the 'May show no awareness of audience' criteria under Score Point 1.\n\nOverall, the essay fits most criteria in both Score Point 1 and Score Point 2. However, it doesn\u2019t completely align with Score Point 1 given it takes a clear position, but it also doesn't completely meet Score Point 2 since its details are all broad and it doesn't show much of organization or audience awareness. Therefore, the grade should be a midpoint between the two.\n\nSCORE: 1.5/6",

        "marker": "The student's response, while it does take a clear position on the topic, lacks a well-articulated argument with clear, specific points. Instead, the points raised, while relevant to the topic, are not fully elaborated upon and the details used are somewhat general, making it unclear if the student truly understands the idea they're presenting.\n\nThe student does, however, show a reasonable level of organization with an introduction of sorts, a body with several points raised, and a conclusion. However, the flow from point-to-point is muddled and could be improved with better usage of transitional phrases to enhance the response's fluency. \n\nIn addition to this, the letter shows only a basic awareness of audience. The student keeps reminding the audience of their point about computers being good for society, which is an effort of trying to persuade the readers to align with their viewpoint. However, it would be more effective if the student had presented their points in a more compelling and elaborate manner. \n\nFinally, in terms of language use, the response is a bit awkward with a lot of repetitive phrasing such as \"that @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing\". Even though there are sentences that do not follow correct English grammar rules, the overall language is simplistic and very easy to understand. \n\nIn light of these considerations, matching with the rubric, the student's response would receive a Score Point 3. The argument is minimally developed and while a position has been taken, it lacks adequate detailed support. The student shows some awareness of audience but would benefit from better language use and transitions to better their argument flow.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends.

        "marker": "The student does take a position in the debate, indicating their belief that computers have a positive effect on society. However, their support for this position is quite minimal, with little elaboration on their reasons.\n\nThe student lists three benefits of using computers: being able to communicate with people around the world, shopping online, and socializing via online platforms. However, these points are not well-developed. For example, the point about online shopping abruptly cuts off, turning into a disjointed, nonsensical sequence of words. The student does not adequately link any of these points back to their main argument or provide an in-depth explanation of why they believe these factors enhance societal wellbeing.\n\nStructurally, the response is weak. It exhibits minimal organization, making it difficult to follow and understand. The introduction, body, and conclusion aren't clearly defined, and the rushed transition from one point to another results in a fragmented narrative.\n\nRegarding language fluency, this submission is riddled with errors and awkward phrases. There is very little transitional language used, adding to the disjointed feel of the piece. Some sentences simply make no sense and are grammatically confusing. These factors reduce the readability and expected professionalism necessary to convincingly persuade a reader.\n\nIn terms of audience awareness, it appears that the student lost sight of the task. They're supposed to be writing a letter to their local newspaper. The numerous typographical and grammatical errors, along with the unpolished, casual language don't fit this formal context. The \"@\" symbols suggest an attempt at a digital format, which is inappropriate for a newspaper letter.\n\nBased on this assessment and the rubric provided, this response appears to align most closely with a Score Point 1 - an undeveloped response that takes a position but provides very minimal support. The lack of in-depth detail and disjointed structure significantly undermine its persuasiveness and readability.\n\nTherefore, after a detailed evaluation, the student is awarded: SCORE: 1/6.",

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "marker": "The student response makes an attempt at responding to the prompt and provides some degree of organization, taking a clear position in favor of computers and detailing several reasons why they are beneficial, such as teaching hand-eye coordination, enabling learning about far-off places and people, and facilitating communication with family and friends.\n\nGoing by the rubric, the response aligns mostly with the criteria for Score Point 4. It provides adequately elaborated reasons with a mix of general and specific details. For example, the student cites the ability of computers to improve hand-eye coordination through games, and further explains how this could potentially impact a person's reflexes. This lends a degree of specificity to an otherwise general point. However, the other points - learning about faraway places and connecting with friends and family online - lack specific details.\n\nThe response also shows satisfactory organization. The structure is clear, and the ideas are presented in a logical way although there isn't much fluent transitional language. The student shows adequate awareness of the audience by directly addressing their viewpoints and attempting to persuade them.\n\nWhere the response falters is in the presentation of arguments. While the student does give reasons, these are common points for anybody advocating in favor of computers. The student does not delve deep to provide strong and unique reasons as to why computers are absolutely essential and cannot be substituted, so the persuasiveness of the argument remains lacking.\n\nGrammar and spelling errors (like 'posotive', 'familly', 'feal', 'meat') also weaken the effectiveness of the student's argument.

In terms of taking a position, the student does take a clear stand i.e., the positive effects of using computers and provides some support.

These unnecessary placeholders are likely misused, making parts of the response confusing to read and interpret.\n\n4.

First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",
        "marker": "The student's response begins by taking a clear position that computers are beneficial. They support their position with three distinct reasons: computers' ability to provide extensive knowledge about other countries, they serve as a source of communication, and they help in getting work done quickly. This shows some level of developed thought and planning, which matches elements of the upper rubric scores.\n\nHowever, the elaboration of their reasons lacks specific details and is minimally elaborated. For example, while the student rightly mentions that computers are good for learning about other cultures, they don't provide concrete examples or anecdotes about how this has personally affected them or society as a whole. Similarly, they mention that computers are helpful for communication, but they only give vague definitions of this point (like the mention of penpals), without specifying its real impact. The third point about efficiency in work again lacks specific examples or details which would make the arguments stronger and more persuasive. \n\nThe organization of the student response is decent. They start with a conclusive statement about their stand on the usefulness of computers, then elaborate on the reasons supporting their stand, and finally conclude by restating their position. However, the response is awkward in parts and shows few transitions. While the response targets a broad audience considering they are writing to a public platform (newspaper), it could do better by using a more engaging language.\n\nThere are quite a few grammatical errors and difficult passages that affect the readability. For example, in \"All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information\", the correct tense should have been used (\"All you would have to do is type it in and it would give you a lot of information\").\n\nOverall, while the response does take a position and provides reasons for the same, the support provided is inadequate and lacks specificity. The response somewhat aligns with Score Point 3 of the rubric due to the reasons mentioned and some organization displayed, but it does not fully satisfy the criteria due to minimal elaboration and more general than specific details.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",
        "marker": "The student's letter demonstrates clear understanding of the task to persuade the readers about their POV concerning the effects of computers on people. They argue that while computers can have negative effects like depriving people of exercise and interactions with their loved ones, their positives outweigh these negatives. The student substantiates their argument with various examples, including their own experiences. These details make their argument convincing and relatable to the readers.\n\nLooking at the rubric:\n\n1. The response provided multiple specific details and explained their relevance, such as the personal benefits of being able to research information for projects and engage in hand-eye coordination through video games. Thus, it meets the benchmark requirement for a high score on this point.\n\n2. The response showed strong organization. The student presented both sides of the argument \u2013 highlighting the negatives before pivoting to, and expanding upon, the positives. This technique effectively guided the reader through the thought process, which speaks to a strong level of organization. \n\n3. However, the fluidity of the letter was slightly compromised by sporadic awkward sentences and a lack of transitional language. \n\n4. The letter showed consistent awareness of the audience. The student used personal examples of how they benefit from computer usage, which likely resonates with others and unifies them around the shared experience. The explicit mention of the audience, \"I hope you see my point of view,\" indicates the student\u2019s awareness that they're writing for a readership.\n\nAlthough the student's ideas were well developed, with reasons explained using specific details, and although the response demonstrated an understanding of the audience, increased transitions and cleaner sentence structures would have improved the fluidity of the writing. \n\nTherefore, a score of 5 out of 6 would be appropriate, indicating that it was a developed response that took a clear position and provided reasonably persuasive support. \n\nSCORE: 5/6",

        "marker": "The student's response falls into Score Point 2. The following is the breakdown of the assessment:\n\n1. Contains only general reasons with unelaborated and/or list-like details: The student's response shows a clear position on the benefits of computer usage. However, the reasons provided for this position are general and lack in-depth explanation. The student lists the benefits of online shopping, chatting on social media, and streaming video without providing more specific details of how these benefit the society.\n\n2. Shows little or no evidence of organization: The essay is marked by a lack of clear structure. The student jumps from one topic to another leading to an unorganized piece of writing. There are also random words, unrecognized symbols, and misplaced words which significantly hinder the flow of the argument and the comprehension of the overall essay.\n\n3. May be awkward and confused or simplistic: Numerous grammatical errors, sentence fragments, lack of clear punctuation, and an overall confusion of words and phrases make the essay awkward and difficult to read and comprehend. For example, \"@CAPS1 and even @CAPS2.V\" does not make much sense to the reader.\n\n4. May show little awareness of audience: The nature of the content, marked with spelling and grammar mistakes, suggests that little consideration is given to the intended audience. The use of colloquial language such as \"Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games..\" might not appeal to the readers of a local newspaper.\n\nIn conclusion, the essay does attempt to argue the use of computers, but the inadequacy of the evidence provided, lack of organization, grammatical errors, and limited awareness of the audience are significant drawbacks. \n\nSCORE: 2/6.",

Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",

However, the ideas presented are not organized or clearly developed. It seems as if the student wrote down their thoughts as they came instead of planning and organizing their response.\n\nConsidering the first point of Score Point 2, the reasons provided by the student against the usage of computers are general and not entirely elaborated. They mention things like obesity and safety concerns with social media, but these reasons lack in-depth details and explanations.\n\nRegarding the second point of the rubric, the student\u2019s response shows little to no evidence of organization. The information is presented in a confusing manner and does not flow logically. This is apparent from the jump between obesity, the environment, and dangers of online interaction. \n\nAs per the third point, the response is quite awkward and simplistic. The student uses rhetorical questions and appears to express their thoughts spontaneously rather than constructing well-formed sentences or arguments. \n\nLastly, there is no clear awareness of audience; the student does not seem to take into consideration that the text should be persuasive given its aim to convince the readers of a newspaper.\n\nGiven these observations, the student\u2019s work more closely aligns with the criteria of Score Point 2.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",
        "marker": "The student takes a clear position on the topic, arguing that computers have a detrimental effect on society. The position is also consistent throughout the essay. For these reasons, we can rule out scoring points 1 and 2 from the rubric.\n\nLooking at the rubric's third point, the student provides reasons with some elaboration and more general than specific details. The student discusses four main concerns about computer usage: obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying. The reasons are clearly listed and somewhat elaborated but often lack specific evidence or examples to strengthen the argument. This level of elaboration falls most in line with scoring points 3 and 4.\n\nIn terms of organization, as per the rubric's point 4, the response shows satisfactory structure. The author presents an introduction, develops their arguments related to each point, and concludes with a summary and a question to the reader. However, the paragraphing could be more refined, and the flow of writing isn't very seamless, which would prevent the response from achieving a higher score.\n\nThe student also shows a good level of audience awareness, in line with point 5 from the rubric. The response is intended as a letter to a local newspaper and reads as such, with direct addresses to the audience (\"Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers\"). However, the syntax is awkward at times and the language is a bit colloquial for the chosen format. This doesn't fully meet the criteria for scoring point 6.\n\nGiven the above observations, the student's response would be best suited to the typical elements found in scoring point 3 on the rubric - a minimally-developed response that takes a position with inadequate support and details, and shows some organization and audience awareness.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer.

However, the support provided for these positions lack depth and specific details.\n\n1. Elaboration and specificity of support: The student does provide some reasons with details, but overall, these details are more general and less specific. For instance, they mention that computers help in emergencies and in bill management but do not provide specific arguments and details to support these claims, which keeps the support at a surface level. Additionally, the text is riddled with inaccuracies and language errors, which impacts the understanding required to evaluate the details sufficiently.\n\n2. Organization: The response shows some organization - the argument is broken down into three separate points to support the claim, although some transitions are missing, making the text flow less smooth.\n\n3. Fluency and transitions: The response is often awkward and confusing due to language inaccuracies. Transitions are also missing between points, which disrupts the fluid storytelling.\n\n4. Awareness of audience: The student's response does show a basic awareness of the audience - the language is informal, and the tone is conversational to persuade the readers, which is appropriate for a letter to a local newspaper.\n\nGiven all these points, the response seems to fall between a score point of 2 and 3, but I will lean towards a 3 since they at least attempted to support each claim even if it was done minimally.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

        "marker": "The student's response is quite developed and takes a clear position stating that kids should have exposure to computers as it gives them an edge in the professional world. The student uses the experts' opinions to back up their stance and provides an anecdotal evidence about how their sister benefited from her early exposure to computers.\n\nIn terms of the organization, the student's response seems to be moderate. There is a logical flow from promoting technology to listing benefits, tackling objections, and suggesting a resolution.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of grammatical issues and misspellings in the text. There are several instances of incorrect sentence structure, wrong use of prepositions and some words, like \"successfull\" and \"presidental\", are misspelled. These major issues decrease the fluency of the text.\n\nThe student also shows some awareness of audience, addressing their concerns and arguments against the position they are supporting, but the delivery where he or she tried to address these issues lacks sophistication, especially in terms of language and style.\n\nSo, based on the rubric, this response appears to falls into the category of Score Point 3: A minimally-developed response.

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": "The student's response begins by taking a clear stance on the topic, thus showing an awareness of the requirements of an opinion letter. The student asserts that the use of computers has a negative effect on people due to their reduced time for exercise, nature, and socialization. This clear articulation of a position on the given issue can favorably place the response in the higher echelons of this rubric scoring system.\n\nSeveral areas, though, fall within the lower levels of the rubric regarding other aspects of the student's response. The student tries to provide reasons for their point of view, but their arguments are more general than specific. For example, the student states that people don't find enough time to exercise but does not provide concrete examples or specific details to back their claim. Instead, the student relies heavily on rhetorical questions to move their argument forward. While this might spark the reader's thought process, it fails to deliver the kind of specific elaboration that might be more persuasive.\n\nThe student's response is also not strongly organized. The transition from one argument to the next is not fluid. Rather, the ideas jump from point to point without adequate linking or logical progression. Here and there, the student's writing becomes awkward and slightly confusing, especially when they try to imagine and preempt what questions the readers might have.\n\nThe student's letter also displays a minimal use of transitional language. They attempt to establish a conversational tone by asking multiple questions and replying to imaginary responses, but this doesn't effectively serve as a smooth or sophisticated transition between arguments.\n\nRegarding audience awareness, the student makes some effort. The conversational style and use of \"you\" might appeal to some readers, but it doesn't consistently display a compelling, audience-focused writing style.\n\nGiven the criterion in the scoring rubric, the response does fall short of the higher rating due to its lack of specific detail, inconsistent organization, and limited transitional language. Therefore, a score of 3 out of 6 seems appropriate for this response. It does have some merit in stating a clear position and showing some audience awareness, but there's significant room for development in detail specificity and argument presentation.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",
        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position and provides some persuasive support, arguing that computers provide a social platform, enable quick access to news and information, and allow for efficient research. This suits the characteristics of a well-established position as per the rubric.\n\nHowever, the response does need improvement in some areas. It has elaborated reasons, and there's a mix of general and specific details. For instance, the student shares the thought that computers allow people to remain connected socially through various websites and instant messaging platforms. They also provide an example under the point of easy access to news by referring to a disaster incident. Albeit the \u2018@LOCATION2\u2019 placeholder hampers the level of specificity in the example. The topic of efficient research is covered in some depth as well, with the mention of online databases and keywords.\n\nThere is some organization in the response, with the usage of paragraphs segregating the different ideas. But, there's room for better structure and flow. One thing lacking is the use of proper transitional phrases that could make connections between the ideas more explicit, contributing to the overall fluency of the essay.\n\nFrom the perspective of audience awareness, the student writes in a style suitable for a newspaper audience, politely offering an opinion and defending it. However, there is an incidence of awkward wording - \"A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there.\" This could lead to some confusion among readers.\n\nOverall, the vocabulary is less sophisticated than it could be, and the response contains several grammatical errors which greatly detract from its readability. These errors range from sentence structure problems, tenses, to punctuation errors throughout the essay. For example, the use of \"&\" instead of \"and,\" missing spaces after commas and periods, multiple typos such as \"proposterous\" instead of \"preposterous,\" \"lastest\" instead of \"latest,\" or \"wont\" instead of \"want\".\n\nThis response aligns most closely with Score Point 3 or Score Point 4. Still, given the frequency of grammatical errors and the more substantial alignment with the characteristics of Score Point 3, it would be reasonable to assign the score accordingly.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

For example, the student mentions cyberbullying and distractive use of computers in school but does not provide specific examples or data that would make these points more impactful and persuasive.\n\nThe organization of the response is not strong. Ideas are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, and the transitions between ideas are not always clear. A better approach would have been to structure the different arguments into separate paragraphs, with smoother transitions between the arguments.\n\nThe language of the response is awkward in places, and there are many mistakes in punctuation, grammar, and spelling, which make parts of the text hard to understand. This shows a lack of fluency and sophistication in written communication.\n\nThe awareness of the audience is somewhat consistent. The student uses a persuasive tone, speaking directly to the reader, and using rhetorical questions to engage the audience. Nevertheless, the repeated errors and occasional awkward phrasings detract from effective communication with the audience.\n\nBased on these criteria and according to the scoring rubric, the student's response falls into Score Point 3.

        "marker": "The student's response takes a clear position towards the use of computers, providing several reasons as to how they believe computers benefit society. These reasons include learning about faraway places, easing the process of studying, and enabling people to communicate with others from around the world. Nonetheless, the response's detail level is mostly general. It offers some specific examples, such as the use of Wikipedia for gathering information or the use of laptops in schools, but these are not fully explained or expanded upon. This places the response within the fourth point of the rubric regarding details.\n\nThe student's response shows some organization, as it groups the mentioned reasons into separate sections. However, the transitions between each point are somewhat awkward, with quick jumps from one topic to another without smoothly guiding the reader through the discussion. This is evident when they talk about how computers allow us to talk to anyone, and then abruptly shift to emails' speed and privacy without much cohesion. The letter's final part, where the student concludes by summarizing their points, demonstrates a satisfactory level of organization, though. These factors place the text within the third and fourth points of the rubric regarding organization and fluency.\n\nThe student's response shows an awareness of its audience - readers of a local newspaper - and attempts to persuade them towards their viewpoint. However, the student's syntactical errors, typos, missing punctuation, and awkward phrasing may make it less engaging and harder to understand for the reader. This makes the language less fluent and the responses fall more towards the third point of the rubric in terms of audience awareness.\n\nIn light of these aspects, the student's response would be best categorized under Score Point 3 on the rubric. The response shows a clear position with general support and details, some organization, and an awareness of the audience. However, it requires better refining in terms of elaboration details, transitioning smoothly from one topic to another, cleaning up grammatical errors, and increasing their fluency to be more persuasive.\n\nSCORE: 3/6.",

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": "The student's response clearly takes a position arguing that computers have a positive effect on people. Hence, the response can't be in Score Point 1 or 2 which refer to an unclear or no position being taken. However, there are several issues with the response.\n\nThe response does provide decently elaborated reasons with a mix of general and specific details discussing how computers help with education, jobs, scheduling, communication, and learning. This aligns with Score Point 4's first typical element. That being said, there are notable instances where the student simply lists benefits without exploring them in decent depth, particularly regarding how computers \"help teach us very important life lessons\". This listing of benefits without further elucidation feels a bit closer to Score Point 3's first characteristic.\n\nThere is some organization shown in the student's response as it starts with education, then moves onto work, then communication, and finally learning. However, the structure does seem to repeat itself at intervals and isn't fluid or coherent, which would fall under Score Point 3's second element rather than Score Point 4's. Transitions between points are also lacking, again favoring Score Point 3 rather than 4 or 5.\n\nThere are numerous spelling and grammar errors throughout which impact the readability and fluency of the response. This, along with the lack of transitional language, suits Score Point 3's third attribute. \n\nFinally, there seems to be an awareness of the audience since the response is attempting to persuade readers about the positive impacts of computers. However, its effect might be reduced by the lack of clarity and writing mistakes. This ambiguous awareness of the audience once again leans more towards Score Point 3's last component, rather than Score Point 4's.\n\nTaking all these facets into account, I would argue the student's response aligns best with the typical elements found in Score Point 3. The response takes a position and provides decent support but is lacking in detail and organization, and contains various spelling and grammar errors.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

Therefore, it fulfills the criterion of having \"fully elaborated reasons with specific details.\"\n\nIn terms of organization, the letter presents a well-constructed argument with distinct sections covering different aspects of the problem at hand. It begins with an introduction of the problem, transitions into the heart of the matter, supports these arguments with data and examples, then summarizes the position strongly in its conclusion. This strong exhibition completes the requisite for \"exhibits strong organization.\"\n\nThe letter demonstrates a good fluency of language.

A more nuanced and sophisticated use of transitional phrases could have helped in better connecting sentences and thoughts. Consistent but unsophisticated fluency characterizes the prose.\n\nThe student also shows an awareness of the audience, presenting the letter as an appeal to the readers of a newspaper. They are making an argument and trying to persuade the recipient to see the issue from their perspective, thereby demonstrating \"a heightened awareness of audience.\"\n\nSo, after considering all aspects, it seems the student falls short in 'fluency with sophisticated transitional language,' making it score less than perfect.\n\nSCORE: 5.5/6.",

They used a fair amount of expressed and implied information from the text to extend understanding beyond the literal, purchased plant and geese observations. They also show an ability to reflect on symbolism and deeper themes by relating the concept of new beginnings to Saeng's failure and her plans of retaking the test.\n\nHowever, the response would have benefited from a more detailed exploration of Saeng's emotional journey throughout the story.

But, there's room for a more profound exploration of Saeng's emotional journey, which would have elevated the response to a perfect score.

There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes \"but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe.\" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast.",
        "marker": "The student's response does touch on two of the major obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempt to dock dirigibles there, referencing the flammability of hydrogen, and the impractical and potentially unsafe nature of mooring such large vessels high above pedestrian traffic. However, the student's writing is less than clear, with some unclear phrasing and grammatical errors that make it difficult to understand the points being made. Additionally, the student's response seems to be missing some important issues from the excerpt, including the legal restriction on low-flying airships over urban areas, and the unwillingness of ship captains to come near the mast due to violent air currents. Therefore, while the student does provide some relevant information from the source material, the response is only a partial description of the obstacles faced. \n\nAccording to the rubric, this response should be awarded a Score Point of 2. It includes limited information from the excerpt and doesn't cover all major obstacles, which signifies a partial response according to the rubric. There are also some misinterpretations including the statement that \"the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen\" which is a misrepresentation of the passage provided. While the student does mention significant points from the text, the lack of coverage, clarity, and certain inaccuracies mean the response cannot be considered completely accurate or complete.\n\nSCORE: 2/4",

        "essay": "When allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles. One of the many obstacles the builders were faced with was the empire state building was not well structured to hold a dirigible of @NUM1 ft and the buildings structure would need to be modified to altleast sisty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle the builders had faced was the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium so hydrogen was very flamable This ment they didnt want something bad to take place above the building and in a \"populated area like downtown new york\". The last main obstacle they had to face was the mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york. Those were the few obstacles the builders had on allowing drigibles to dock near the empire state building",
        "marker": "The student's response does a fairly good job of identifying and describing the obstacles in having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, but there are some inaccuracies and the supporting evidence could be more specific.\n\nThe student correctly identifies the issue of the building's structure needing modification to support a mooring mast for dirigibles, but misinterprets the part about the size of the dirigibles and the cost of the modification. The student mentioned that a dirigible of \"@NUM1 ft\" would add stress to the building's frame. However, in the text, it was not specified that the dirigible's size was an issue, but rather the concept of having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress. The cost of the modification was not clear in the student's response and could be better articulated.\n\nIn terms of the issue of the flammability of hydrogen, the student's response is generally accurate. However, they could have referenced the Hindenburg disaster more specifically as a contributing factor to the safety issues and concerns.\n\nThe last obstacle mentioned by the student has some inaccuracies. \"The mooring mast was always differer by the nature around it and the dirigibles would wear on its causing danger to people in the town of new york.\" This seems to be a misinterpretation. The real issue was due to the constantly shifting winds at the top of the building which would cause a tethered dirigible to swivel dangerously. This was a safety concern not because it would \"wear on its\" but due to the risk it posed to the dirigible and people below.\n\nThe student's answer is mostly clear, but it is not entirely accurate and specific. Therefore, it is more fitting of the description for Score Point 2. \n\nSCORE: 2/4",

        "essay": "The builders of the Empire State Building faced lots of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction. When the air crafts were moored in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State building they would be dangling high above civilians and pedestrians on the street which caused great a harm for the public.",

The student successfully relays that the obstacles included the challenge of designing and modifying the building's steel frame to accommodate the mooring mast, the risk of accident due to dirigibles' hydrogen filling, and the issue related to windy conditions that made mooring risky and impractical.\n\nThe student's response is consistently on point, reflecting an understanding of the topic, and language use is mostly precise. References to the excerpt are accurately used to make relevant points throughout the essay. For example, the student refers to the Hindenburg disaster as a clear illustration of the dangerous nature of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, and provides an effective overview of the design modifications necessary to accommodate the mooring mast.\n\nHowever, they missed a significant obstacle mentioned in the excerpt: the law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it essentially illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. While it's a minor oversight, comprehensiveness requires it to be mentioned. Still, overall, this student's response is comprehensive, demonstrating they understood and synthesized the information from the excerpt effectively. \n\nTherefore, the student's answer sits between score point 3 and 4, but considering the well-structured format, the level of detail, and with only one minor omission, a grade of 4 is justified.\n\nSCORE: 4/4",

Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

Instead, the student wrote a narrative about being a \"patient\" in the hospital, which is a different concept. Although it can be argued that a degree of patience is expected when you are a patient in a hospital, indirect relation doesn't focus on the essence of the prompt. There are no developed ideas or details that support the theme of patience. Based on this, I would give a score of 2 for Ideas.\n\n2. Organization: The student's story is sequenced logically from when they first went to the hospital, had a medical procedure and then accidentally hurt themselves, leading to a longer stay. However, the connections between ideas are not strong due to the misunderstanding of the concept of \"patience\". This results in weak organization and earns a score of 1 for Organization.\n\n3. Style: The student's command of language is limited. There is a lack of variety in word choice and sentence structure, which hinders support for their purpose, which seems to be recounting an event rather than focusing on the topic of patience. Based on the rubric, the student would receive a score of 1 for Style.\n\n4. Conventions: The student uses conventions of Standard English for the most part. Punctuation and capitalization are mostly correct, though there is a lack of proper punctuation with run-on sentences (\"I was sick for a very long time so my mom took to the hospital and I got shot.\"), which can cause confusion for the reader. For this category, I would assign a score of 2.\n\nSCORE: 6/15.",

The relevance to the topic is apparent, a testament to the anticipation that is tied to patience.\n\nIdeas:\nThe student's ideas clearly focus on the theme of patience. The waiting for the goalkeeper shirt indicates patience, and the idea is developed with specific details as indicated by the story, hence a score of 6.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story is logically sequenced and straightforward. The way the student tells how he found the shirt in a catalog, wanted the shirt, waited for the shirt, and finally got the shirt showed a clear chronological sequence. Therefore, the student will receive full points for Organization, scoring a 3.\n\nStyle:\nThe student adequately uses language to convey his thoughts. Although the student has not used varied sentence structure and the word choice does not particularly 'pop', the sentences were clear and supportive of telling the narrative; thus a score of 2 is awarded for this category.\n\nConventions:\nThe grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are correctly used in the student's writing.

As per the rubric, we can assign a score of 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe story is organized in a logical sequence with a clearly identified beginning (waiting) and end (finally getting called in). There isn't much development in the middle, but the connections between ideas/events seem logical.

        "marker": "The student's response does indeed tell a story about patience, meeting the requirements of the prompt. They detail the experience of having to wait in a long queue for a roller coaster ride at a theme park.\n\nFor \"ideas\", the student's story is commendably focused on the topic of patience, as they developed the concept throughout the narrative. The story was detailed with circumstances where patience was relevant, particularly the two-hour wait for a roller coaster ride. The only hindrance is a bit of vagueness in connecting the story back to the core concept of patience. Since there is minor confusion, I would give this a score of 4 out of 6.\n\nFor \"Organization\", the student's response was logically sequenced, starting from the preparation phase, then the arrival at the park, the sight of the long queue, their decision to wait patiently, and then drawing a conclusion. However, the sudden introduction of riding the roller coaster without providing the context of what they were waiting for is a little jarring. As a result, I would give this a score of 2 out of 3 due to the narrative's generally logical sequencing but lack of clarity about certain elements. \n\nFor the \"Style\" category, the student shows an adequate command of language, effective word choice and clear sentences that support the writer's purpose to underscore the virtue of patience. However, the variety in sentence structure is quite limited. Therefore, I would assign a score of 2 out of 3 in this category.\n\nThe \"Conventions\" category is responsible for a major proportion of the deduction in the total score. The student's response contains several instances of inappropriate use of conventions of Standard English. Misused capitalization (@CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @NUM1, @LOCATION1), missing punctuation, and directional errors (\"hopped into the can\" instead of \"van\" or \"car\") detract from the response's overall quality and coherence. Consequently, the score is 1 out of 3 in this category.\n\nIn summary, the student demonstrated a sound understanding of the topic and was able to create a narrative around it.

Many parts of the story require more specific and relevant details to fully explain how he exercised patience. He does not delve much into his feelings of impatience or how he overcame them. So, the score for this section would be 4.\n\nOrganization: The student's story is logically sequenced. However, the connections between some events and ideas could be clearer. For instance, there is no clear link between helping the woman and his cousin coming over. Thus, the organization score would be 2.\n\nStyle: The command of language, word choice, and sentence structure is not quite adequate. The use of '@CAPS' distracts from the reading and understanding of the story. There's also not much variety or compelling use of language. This section earns a score of 1.\n\nConventions: The student's use of Standard English conventions is notably limited. The response is riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, and uses casual language that is not appropriate for an exam setting. Words like \"wrighting\", \"board\" instead of \"bored\", \"grocres\", and the repeated use of '@CAPS' all detract. The score for this section would be 1.\n\nRational: While the student's attempt is clearly made, there is a lack of specific detail and development in the storytelling.

Therefore, the score for Ideas is 4.\n\nThe organization and connections between ideas and events are somewhat weak. The series of events is logically sequenced, but the connections between them are not always clear. Also, many places in the text, name placeholders are used without replacing them which disrupts the flow of the story. Therefore, the score for Organization is 1.\n\nLanguage use in the response is limited. There is a lack of varied sentences and word choices. The student also did not effectively use language to clearly support the story's purpose and the intended audience. Therefore, the score for Style is 1.\n\nThe student used conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation but with limited accuracy. There are several errors in capitalization, especially with the placeholder names which disrupts the overall readability. Therefore, the score for Conventions is 1.  \n\nOverall, the student demonstrates some understanding of the prompt, but makes errors in organization, style, and conventions which affect the clarity and effectiveness of the story. \n\nSCORE: 7/15",

We were suppose to be going to @CAPS1 adventures and my grandma said she wanted me and my cousins to be ready by a certain time so we wouldn\u0092t get there that late. So the next day we get to her house right there at @NUM1 like she said and we had found out that she had over slept and we all looked at one another because we new that it was going to take a long time. So I said that\u0092s ok we can wait and we all went into her house and waited until every one was ready. So as we were walking out I noticed that my grandparent were caring suitcases and I said why do you guys carring suitcases my grandma and that we were going to spend the night in a hotel I so we would be even closer to @CAPS1 adventures.

        "marker": "The student's response relates an experience where patience was exercised but lacks depth in the exploration of the theme of patience.\n\nIdeas: The student tells a story but the focus on the topic of patience isn\u2019t thoroughly developed. Despite starting by stating being at the Grandma's house and waiting for her to be ready was an act of patience, the response doesn't delve deeper into what made it a patient act or how the writer or others felt during the wait. Additionally, the latter part of the story is more about the trip and less about exercising patience. Hence, the target isn\u2019t met fully, and idea score given is Score 4. \n\nOrganization: The story is logically sequenced from getting to Grandma's house, waiting for her, and the subsequent events that occurred. However, the focus gets diffused as the story progresses which indicates slightly unclear connections between ideas. Therefore, I'd give an organization score of Score 2. \n\nStyle: The response uses simple and clear language, but there are limited variations in word choice and sentence structure. The writer's purpose could be more effectively communicated with a richer use of language. This would give the style Score 1. \n\nConventions: There are certain errors in the use of conventions of the English language including misuse of punctuation marks, spelling errors (e.g., \"new\" instead of \"knew\"), improper use of verb forms (e.g., \"I said why do you guys carring\") and lack of sentence completeness (e.g., \"Even though we were supposed to go\"). This results in a significant amount of confusion, yielding a conventions score of Score 1. \n\nTo summarize, even though the student has made an effort to follow the instruction and write a story related to patience, there is room for improvement in the depth of conceptual understanding, language command, and attention to grammatical rules. Therefore, the total score considering all elements of the rubric would be 8/15 (Ideas 4, Organization 2, Style 1, and Conventions 1). \n\nSCORE: 8/15.",

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",
        "marker": "The student's response is centered on their personal experience of being patient when waiting for a turn to play a video game, which aligns with the exam question. The introductory sentence and the conclusion stress the importance of patience, which reinforces the central theme.\n\nIdeas:\nThe narrative is centered around the theme of patience and the student gave specific, relevant details about their family and the situation that required their patience. However, the narrative could have been better developed and more in-depth to fully illustrate the concept of patience. Score:  4/6\n\nOrganization:\nThe story is logically sequenced, with the introduction and conclusion enveloping the main anecdote. The connections between ideas are clear and the events build upon one another to culminate in the climax of finally playing the game after hours of waiting patiently. Score: 3/3\n\nStyle:\nThe student uses simple language and straightforward sentence structures. Their voice remains constant throughout, but the choice of words and sentences could have been more varied and compelling to better support the writer's purpose and engage the audience. Score: 2/3\n\nConventions:\nThe writing shows an understanding of the basic conventions of Standard English. However, there are a few words that have been incorrectly spelled (e.g. \"patiente\") and punctuation errors (\"it\u0092s\" instead of \"it's\"). Score: 2/3\n\nIn conclusion, the story has room for improvement regarding depth, language variety, and attention to spelling and punctuation, but it is still a satisfactory response to the prompt. \n\nFINAL SCORE: 11/15.",

        "marker": "The student's response demonstrates a clear story that is focused on the topic, which is patience. They do a good job of tying in the concept of patience with the example of applying makeup. They develop their ideas effectively, with specific details, such as the dialogue between the protagonist and mom, the allowance, the retail, and the learning process. Thus, the student's work warrants a score of 6 for ideas.\n\nThe story's organization is sufficient, but it could be improved. The events are logically sequenced as the student builds on the initial interest in makeup, leading to the purchase and the practice. However, the connection between some ideas is not very clear, such as the importance of the protagonist's sister in relation to patience, and the abrupt transition concerning the protagonist's first try in applying makeup. Therefore, the organization merits a score of 2. \n\nIn terms of style, the student's language and sentence structure are clear and support the writer's purpose. The command of language is adequate, but the word choice and variety in sentence structure are lacking in certain areas. There is also an overuse of quotes that sometimes hampers the clarity of the narrative. As a result, the student achieves a score of 2 for style.\n\nRegarding conventions, the student's response displays adequate use of Standard English. However, there are a few issues with punctuation, most noticeably the overuse of quotation marks and a couple run-on sentences. The usage of @signs also hampers the clarity of the reading, which could be a typing-related error. Consequently, they warrant a score of 2 for conventions. \n\nTo summarize, the student's understanding of patience is well-demonstrated in a clear story with a consistently focused theme. However, the organization, style, and conventions could use improvement, particularly in terms of clearer transitions, varied sentence structures, and better punctuation use.\n\nSCORE: 12/15",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
        "marker": "The student's response tells a personal and vivid story centering on the theme of patience, the theme explicitly foregrounded in the prompt. They substantially demonstrates patience while teaching his little brother to play catch with a football, even when the sisters gave up. This makes it clear that the student understood the task and developed a story around the prompt, fitting the criteria for a score 6 under 'Ideas'. \n\nIn terms of 'Organization', the student's narrative is logically sequenced. The events from the family gathering to the attempts of teaching the brother and the eventual success are well arranged, providing a clear movement of narrative. However, the story could benefit from better transition phrases to create a smoother flow between ideas. Therefore, the student would score a 2 for organization. \n\nIn 'Style', the student demonstrates a satisfactory command of language that supports their purpose, but has limited variation in sentence structure. The narrative, at times, seems redundant due to the continuous repetition of phrases. There is occasional evidence of sophisticated word choice, such as \"exclaimed\", but this is not consistent. Accordingly, the student would score a 2 under 'Style'. \n\nRegarding 'Conventions', while the student's use of grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation conventions is generally adequate, there are several slips. Some of the sentences are oddly phrased, such as \"I was really alod that I had token the time to help him\" and certain words are incorrectly capitalized (e.g. \"@CAPS1\", \"@CAPS2\", \"@CAPS3\"). Hence, for 'Conventions', the student would score 1.\n\nIn summary, the student addressed the question with a clear story centered on patience, but the organization, style, and conventions could be improved. The final grade would be:\n\nSCORE: 11/15.",
