They mention two positive aspects of computers (communication with friends and family, and looking for jobs), but there is no elaboration or supporting evidence. The response is so short that it is difficult to assess the student's understanding or awareness of audience.\n\nAssessment: SCORE: 1/6 (Score Point 1)\n\nAccording to the rubric, a score of 1 indicates an undeveloped response with minimal support. In this case, the student's response is so brief that it fails to meet even the minimal criteria for a developed response. Therefore, I award a score of 1 out of 6.\n\nNext, let me provide some feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\nFeedback:\n\n* The response lacks detail and elaboration on the positive aspects of computers.\n* The student should consider providing more specific examples and evidence to support their position.\n* The response could benefit from more organization and transitional language to improve readability and flow.\n* The student should consider addressing potential counterarguments or acknowledging different perspectives on the topic.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n* Provide more specific examples of how computers can be beneficial.\n* Offer evidence to support your position, such as statistics or personal experiences.\n* Organize your response into clear paragraphs with transitional language.\n* Consider addressing potential counterarguments or acknowledging different perspectives on the topic.\n\nOverall, the student's response is underdeveloped and lacks support for their position. To improve, the student should focus on providing more detail, evidence, and organization in their response. Additionally, the student should consider addressing potential counterarguments and acknowledging different perspectives on the topic to strengthen their argument.",

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive.

There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

The response assumes that the audience will share the same assumptions and perspectives.\n\nScore: 4/6\n\nBased on the above evaluation, I would assign a score of 3/6 to the student's response. The response shows some effort and attempts to address the prompt, but it is mainly a list of general statements without any depth or nuance. The lack of organization, language, and audience awareness also detract from the response's overall effectiveness.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

However, there are several areas that need improvement, and I will provide my detailed feedback and rationale for each point.\n\n1. Organization:\n\nThe response is somewhat under-organized. While the student has identified some negative effects of computers, such as obesity, cramps, sexual harassment, and cyberbullying, the ideas are not well-connected and lack a clear structure. The transitions between paragraphs are awkward, making it difficult for the reader to follow the student's line of reasoning.\n\nScore: 2/3 (Score Point 2)\n\n2. Reasons and Support:\n\nThe student has provided some reasons why computers have a negative impact on people. However, the reasons are generally list-like and lack elaboration. For instance, the student simply states that \"cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead\" without providing any specific examples or evidence to support their claim. Similarly, the student does not offer any quantifiable data or research to back up their arguments.\n\nScore: 1.5/2 (Score Point 1.5)\n\n3. Language and Style:\n\nThe language used in the response is simple and somewhat awkward.

Moreover, the tone of the response is inconsistent \u2013 at times, it is assertive and persuasive, but other times it is naive and immature.\n\nScore: 2/3 (Score Point 2)\n\n4. Awareness of Audience:\n\nThe student's awareness of the audience is somewhat limited. The response does not take into account the potential audience for the letter to the editor, and the language and tone may not be appropriate for a broad readership. Additionally, the student does not address any potential counterarguments or acknowledge different perspectives on the issue.\n\nScore: 1.5/2 (Score Point 1.5)\n\nBased on the above evaluation, I would award the following score:\n\nSCORE: 4/6 (Score Point 4)\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the negative effects of computers but lacks adequate support, organization, and clarity. With more attention to detail, structure, and language, the student could improve their response and better address the prompt.",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events.

This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow.

The student's response is somewhat organized, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. However, the transition between sentences and paragraphs is sometimes awkward, and there are a few instances of list-like details. Overall, I would score this aspect of the response as a 3 out of 6.\n\nNext, I'll assess the student's use of specific details and elaboration. The student provides some specific details about the benefits of computers, such as the ability to research topics quickly and easily, and the fact that online news is widely popular. However, the details are not always fully elaborated, and the response sometimes feels a bit list-like.

The student does show some awareness of audience, as they address the reader directly and use language that is appropriate for a newspaper article. However, there are a few instances where the language is overly simplistic or awkward, which detracts from the overall effectiveness of the response. I would score this aspect of the response as a 3 out of 6.\n\nFourth, I'll assess the student's use of persuasive language and rhetorical devices. The student does use some persuasive language, such as \"the computer has a positive effect on society\" and \"the computer is and always will be beneficial to society.\" However, the use of persuasive language is not consistent throughout the response, and there are no clear rhetorical devices or strategies used to reinforce the student's position. I would score this aspect of the response as a 4 out of 6.\n\nFinally, I'll evaluate the overall effectiveness of the student's response. The student presents a clear position on the benefits of computers, and provides some specific details to support their argument. However, the response is sometimes awkwardly written and lacks persuasive language and rhetorical devices. Overall, I would award a score of 4 out of 6.\n\nSCORE: 4/6",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe.

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's.

Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement.

However, this statement is rather generic and doesn't offer any specific examples or analysis.\n\n2. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. (supported)\n\nThe student offers their first example from the text, which is the speed limit sign. They correctly interpret the sign as making the cyclist feel like life is cruel.

Addresses the demands of the question: The student responds to the question and provides reasons why the author concludes the story with the last paragraph. However, the response is not comprehensive, and some aspects of the question are not fully addressed.\n2. Uses expressed and implied information from the text: The student references the last paragraph of the story and correctly identifies the main idea as Saeng missing home and being determined to pass the test when the geese return in the spring. However, the student does not fully clarify or extend their understanding beyond the literal, relying mainly on the text's surface-level meaning.\n3. Clarifies and extends understanding beyond the literal: The student's response is mostly focused on the text itself, without fully connecting the ideas to a broader context or themes. There is no discussion of implied meanings, symbolism, or deeper themes that might be present in the story.\n\nIn terms of evidence of understanding, the response is adequate but not outstanding. The student correctly identifies the main idea of the last paragraph but does not provide a deeper analysis of the text's themes or implications. Additionally, the response is somewhat incomplete, as it does not address all aspects of the question.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the story and its conclusion, but could benefit from further development and connection of ideas.

Here's my detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nFirst of all, I would like to commend the student for trying to describe the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. However, there are some areas where the response falls short of capturing the intended mood accurately.\n\nThe student's response is mostly focused on the themes of gratitude, happiness, and thankfulness, which are indeed present in the memoir, but the response does not fully capture the nuances of the mood created by the author. For example, the student mentions that Narciso is \"happy\" because he gets to see his parents and grandparents, but the memoir actually conveys a deeper sense of joy and belonging.\n\nMoreover, the student's response seems to be based on a superficial interpretation of the text. For instance, the student states that Narciso was \"asked to be born in America,\" which is not an accurate representation of the text. Narciso's parents actually immigrated to America to give their children a better life, but the author does not implies that he was \"asked\" to be born in America.\n\nAdditionally, the student's response lacks specific details from the text to support their claims. For example, the student does not mention any specific events, scenes, or quotes from the memoir to illustrate Narciso's gratitude, happiness, or thankfulness. This lack of specific details makes the response seem more general and less accurate.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the mood created by the author. The response includes limited information from the memoir and may include misinterpretations.\n\nThe student's response does provide some relevant information about the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez, but it is largely incomplete and inaccurate.

Here's my detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response, along with my rationale for the grade I assign and the score I give:\n\nFirst, let me say that the student has made a good effort to describe the mood created by the author in the passage. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved, and I will address each of these points below.\n\n1. relevance to the task: The student's response is somewhat relevant to the task, as they mention the mood created by the author and provide some specific information from the passage. However, the response could be more focused on the mood created by the author, rather than veering off into details about the author's home, nationality, family, and neighborhood. SCORE: 1/4\n\n2. completeness: The student's response is partial and lacks depth. The student mentions a few specific details from the passage, such as the author's nationality and the fact that he lives in an apartment in Newark, New Jersey. However, the response does not provide a comprehensive description of the mood created by the author, and it does not fully address the task. SCORE: 2/4\n\n3. accuracy: The student's response contains some inaccuracies and misinterpretations. For example, the student states that the author is \"proud to be born in Cuba,\" but the passage does not convey this sentiment. Additionally, the student mentions the author's bedroom, but the passage does not specify the size or location of the author's bedroom. SCORE: 2/4\n\n4. organization: The student's response is somewhat organized, but it could be improved. The response jumps between different topics, such as the author's nationality, family, and neighborhood, without a clear connection between them. SCORE: 2/4\n\n5. language use: The student's language use is straightforward and easy to understand, but it could be more precise and sophisticated. The response contains some grammatical errors, such as using \"that\" instead of \"who\" in one place. SCORE: 2/4\n\nBased on the rubric, I would give the student a score of 2/4, as their response is partial and contains some inaccuracies and misinterpretations. However, the student has made a good effort to describe the mood created by the author, and with some revisions and improvements, they could achieve a higher score.",

        "marker": " SURE, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\n1. The first sentence of the student's response states that the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad. However, the memoir does not convey a predominantly sad tone. Instead, it is a warm and nostalgic reflection on the author's childhood.\n2. The second sentence of the student's response acknowledges that the author is grateful for his parents' hard work and the good times they had, but the tone of the sentence is ambiguous and does not accurately convey the author's emotions.\n3. The third sentence of the student's response is a correct observation that the author misses the good times in his childhood. However, the sentence is not well-supported by the text and does not contribute to a clear description of the mood created by the author.\n4. The final sentence of the student's response is a vague statement that the author is happy for having a good childhood. This sentence does not provide any specific evidence from the text to support the student's claim.\n\nBased on the student's response, I would assign a score of 1/4, as the response is minimal and does not accurately describe the mood created by the author in the memoir. The student's response does not provide specific examples or quotes from the text to support their claims, and the sentences do not flow logically from one another to create a cohesive description of the mood. Additionally, the student's response contains some misinterpretations of the text, such as the claim that the author is sad when the memoir does not convey that emotion.\n\nTherefore, the score I would assign is:\n\nSCORE: 1/4\n\nThank you for providing the rubric, as it helps me to accurately evaluate the student's response and provide explicit feedback on their performance.",

This is a correct interpretation of the text, as the author describes the warm and welcoming environment of his childhood home.\n\nStep 2: Does the response include relevant and specific information from the memoir?\n\nThe student's response does include relevant and specific information from the memoir.

They provide relevant information from the memoir to support their claim, such as the author's description of the welcoming and caring environment created by their parents. However, there are a few minor errors and omissions that prevent me from awarding a perfect score.\n\nScore Point 3: The response is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the mood created by the author.\n\nThe student's response is mostly clear and complete, but there are a few areas where they could provide more detail or accuracy. For example, they mention that the author's family welcomed other refugees, but they could have elaborated on this point to further support their argument. Additionally, there are a few minor errors in their writing, such as using \" thier\" instead of \"their.\"\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the mood created by the author.\n\nThe student's response is partially accurate, but there are several gaps in their argument. For example, they do not discuss the specific examples of love and caring that the author includes in the memoir, such as the passages about the author's first birthdays and the Cuban feasts. Additionally, there are a few misinterpretations, such as their reference to the author's family as \"refugees.\"\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the mood created by the author.\n\nThe student's response is minimal and does not provide a clear or accurate description of the mood created by the author. They do not offer any specific examples or evidence from the memoir to support their claim.\n\nOR The response relates minimally to the task.\n\nThe student's response does not fully address the task and does not provide a clear or accurate description of the mood created by the author.\n\nScore: 3/4\n\nOverall, the student's response is mostly complete and accurate, but there are a few areas where they could provide more detail or accuracy. They provide relevant information from the memoir to support their claim, but there are a few minor errors and omissions. Therefore, I award a score of 3/4.",

Clarity and completeness: The student's response is mostly clear and complete, but there are some areas where it falls short.\n\nThe student begins by summarizing the mood created by the author, stating that the memoir shows a sense of satisfaction and love for Cuba, and that the author is relieved that his family made it to the United States safely. However, the student's description could be more detailed and specific. For example, the student does not provide any specific examples from the memoir to support their claims.\n\n2. Relevance to the task: The student's response is relevant to the task, as it does address the question and provides some examples from the memoir to support their claims. However, the response could be more focused on the mood created by the author, rather than veering off into a discussion of the author's family and their experiences.\n\n3. Accuracy: The student's response is mostly accurate, but there are some areas where it contains misinterpretations or inconsistencies. For example, the student states that the author's family \"whent\" through a tough transition, when the correct word would be \"went.\" Additionally, the student mentions that the author is relieved that his family made it to the United States \"sofly and sand,\" when the correct word would be \"smoothly and safely.\" These minor errors detract from the overall accuracy of the response.\n\n4. Use of relevant and specific information from the text: The student's response could benefit from more specific and relevant information from the memoir. While the student does mention some specific details, such as the author's love of Cuban food and music, these details are not closely tied to the mood created by the author. To earn a higher score, the student should have provided more specific examples from the memoir that illustrate the mood created by the author.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 3 out of 4. The student's response is mostly clear and complete, but it could benefit from more specific and relevant information from the memoir.

Here's a detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nFirst, let's read the student's answer:\n\n\"When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the building's framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building.\"\n\nNow, let's evaluate the student's response based on the provided rubric:\n\nScore Point 4: The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt.\n\nThe student's response is mostly clear and complete, but there are a few areas that need improvement. Here's a breakdown of the response:\n\n* Relevant and specific information from the excerpt: The student mentions several obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, including the need to reconstruct the building's framework, the strong wind currents at the tip of the building, and the existing law against dirigible height. These are all relevant and specific details from the excerpt.\n* Clarity and accuracy: The student's response is mostly clear and accurate, but there are a few areas where the answer could be improved. For example, the student mentions \"reconstructing the building's framework\" without providing any specific details about what that involved. Additionally, the student's statement about the wind currents could be more accurate. While it is true that the wind currents were a concern, the excerpt does not mention the wind currents \"rotating\" the dirigible around the mooring mast. Instead, it mentions that the wind currents were shifting and unpredictable, which made it difficult to moor the dirigible safely.\n\nBased on these factors, I would award the student a score of 3 out of 4. The response is mostly clear, complete, and accurate, but could be improved with more specific details and a more accurate understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.\n\nHere's the final grade in the format requested:\n\nSCORE: 3/4",

This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians.

Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.\n\n Based on the rubric provided, I will evaluate the student's response point by point.\n\nScore Point 4: The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt.\n\nThe student's response clearly describes the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. They mention three obstacles: safety concerns related to the use of hydrogen-filled dirigibles, natural wind currents that would make it unsafe to moor the dirigibles, and legal limitations on flying low over urban areas.\n\nThe response includes specific information from the provided excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen in dirigibles and the risk of fires, the constant shifting of wind currents, and the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the given text.\n\nScore Point 3: The response is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant but often general information from the excerpt.\n\nIf I were to deduct points, I would deduct one point for the following reasons:\n\nWhile the student mentions specific information from the excerpt, their description of the third obstacle (legal limitations) is somewhat general. They simply state that \"There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas.\" Without further explanation or context, this statement seems disconnected from the rest of the response.\n\nAdditionally, the student's response could benefit from more detail and organization. They jump abruptly from discussing the specific obstacles to summarizing that the builders had to face many obstacles. A clearer structure, with transitions between points and more explicit connections to the task, would strengthen the response.\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes limited information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nIf I were to further deduct points, I would deduct one more point for the following reasons:\n\nThe student's response contains some misinterpretations or limitations in their description of the obstacles. For example, they state that the law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas \"would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building.\" This is not entirely accurate, as the law the excerpt mentions (an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas) relates more broadly to flying airships in general and not specifically to docking them at the Empire State Building.\n\nMoreover, the student's response generally lacks depth and nuance. They do not explore the specific challenges or implications of the obstacles mentioned, and do not offer any examples, details, or supporting evidence from the excerpt.\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes little or no information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nIf I were to deduct further points, I would deduct one more point for the following reason:\n\nThe student's response does not demonstrate a full understanding of the text and is overly brief. They provide little detail or evidence to support their claims and do not engage with the specific concepts or challenges mentioned in the excerpt.\n\nScore: 2/4.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would award a score of 2 out of 4 points to the student's response. While the response generally describes the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it contains some misinterpretations, lacks depth and nuance, and could benefit from more detail and organization.",

        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\n\nThe student's story is somewhat focused on the topic of patience, but the ideas could be more fully developed. The story is based on a personal experience with the student's grandparents, which is a good start. However, the student could have explored the idea of patience more deeply by discussing how they felt while waiting, what they learned from the experience, or how it impacted their relationship with their grandparents.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's story is logically sequenced, but could benefit from more connections between ideas and events. The story jumps from the grandparents being late to the student and cousins waiting at home, and then to the group eventually arriving at the adventure. Adding more transitions and connections between ideas would make the story flow better and more smoothly.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but could be more effective in supporting their purpose and audience. The writing is clear and understandable, but it lacks variety in word choice and sentence structure. The student could benefit from using more descriptive language and varied sentence structures to make the story more engaging and interesting.\n\nConventions:\n\nThe student's use of conventions is consistent and appropriate for the grade level, with a few minor errors in spelling and punctuation. However, these errors do not hinder the student's meaning or clarity.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score the student's response as follows:\n\nIdeas: 4/6 (partially focused on the topic, but could be more fully developed)\nOrganization: 2/3 (logically sequenced, but could benefit from more connections between ideas and events)\nStyle: 2/3 (adequate use of language, but could be more effective in supporting the purpose and audience)\nConventions: 3/3 (consistent and appropriate use of conventions, with a few minor errors)\n\nTotal score: 10/15\n\nTherefore, I would award the student a score of 10/15 for their response to the exam question.",

        "essay": "Who likes being patient it\u0092s so boring. Preaty much all it does is waste your time. But we all know it\u0092s good to be patient and to have patience. I am not a really patiente person but they\u0092re lots of times where I have had to be patiente.  When I was @NUM1 years old I lived in @LOCATION1 with a family of six not including me. I really liked video games and I have @NUM2 older brothers and @NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. That was the game cube. Also we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patiente to wait your turn because my older brothers always got to play first and they would never get off. But there was this one time that was harder than all the others. I got a brand new video game called @PERSON1 bros and couldn\u0092t wait to play it. But when I got home my brothers snatched it out of my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and mad, but I didn\u0092t complain I just sat right behind the door of the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but I was still not complained. I ended up sitting there for @NUM4 hours. Finally my brother opened the door and said I could come in. Not in a very nice way but I got to play. I remember to this day how hard it was but after, it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something you really really want to do and you can\u0092t do it just be patient and it will pay off.",

My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did!
