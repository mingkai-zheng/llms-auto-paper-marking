        "marker": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you assess and grade the student's answer. Here's my step-by-step review of the response:\n\n1. Content (4 points):\nThe student's answer touches on the topic but lacks depth and specificity. The statement \"I think computers are good because you can talk to your friends and family on the computers\" is too general and does not take a clear position on the topic. Additionally, the statement \"Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop\" is too simplistic and does not provide any supporting evidence.\n2. Organization and Structure (2 points):\nThe student's answer lacks a clear organization and structure. There is no introduction, body, or conclusion, and the ideas are presented in a list-like fashion.\n3. Writing Quality (2 points):\nThe student's writing is awkward and fragmented, with incomplete sentences and unclear phrasing. For example, the statement \"Some people spend to much time on the computers then on homework people need to stop\" is unclear and lacks proper grammar.\n4. Audience Awareness (1 point):\nThe student's answer does not show any awareness of the audience. The language used is too informal and does not consider the reader's perspective.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this response as follows:\n\nContent (4 points): 2/4 (the student's answer lacks depth and specificity)\nOrganization and Structure (2 points): 1/2 (the student's answer lacks a clear organization and structure)\nWriting Quality (2 points): 1/2 (the student's writing is awkward and fragmented)\nAudience Awareness (1 point): 0/1 (the student's answer does not show any awareness of the audience)\n\nTotal Score: 3/6\n\nTherefore, I would give the student a score of 3/6 for this response. While the student has attempted to address the topic, the response lacks depth, organization, and proper writing skills. To improve, the student should focus on providing more specific examples and supporting evidence, organizing their ideas in a clear and logical manner, and using proper grammar and sentence structure.",

Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Let's review the student's response and determine an appropriate grade based on the rubric provided.\n\nFirst, I will summarize the student's response:\n\nThe student presents their opinion on the benefits of computers, stating that computers are helpful for finding information, staying in touch with others, and receiving important messages. They provide examples of how they use computers for these purposes, such as searching for homework help and communicating with friends through email and social media.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the response using the rubric:\n\nScore Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\nThe student's response is largely undeveloped, with only a few sentences that touch on their opinion and reasons for why computers are beneficial. There is little to no support for their position, and the details provided are very vague. Therefore, I would score this response as a 1, as it does not meet the criteria for any of the higher score points.\n\nScore Point 2: An under-developed response that may or may not take a position.\n\nAlthough the student takes a position in their response, they do not provide adequate support for their argument. The reasons given are general and unelaborated, and there is little evidence of organization.

However, the support is still somewhat lacking in detail and specificity. The response is organized but could benefit from more transition phrases to connect ideas. Therefore, I would score this response as a 4.\n\nScore Point 5: A developed response that takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is developed, as it takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support. The response is well-organized and includes specific examples and details to support the argument. However, the language and tone could be more sophisticated, and there could be more attention to audience awareness. Therefore, I would score this response as a 5.\n\nScore Point 6: A well-developed response that takes a clear and thoughtful position and provides persuasive support.\n\nBased on the rubric, the student's response does not quite meet the criteria for a well-developed response. While the response is developed and provides persuasive support, it could benefit from more sophisticated language and tone, as well as greater attention to audience awareness. Therefore, I would score this response as a 5.\n\nSCORE: 5/6\n\nOverall, the student's response is somewhat developed and provides some support for their position, but it could benefit from more detail and sophistication in both language and organization.",

What kinds of information can we access through computers that we might not have otherwise?]\n\nAlso you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends.

Could they provide more specific examples of websites or online communities where we can connect with others?]\n\nSome people prefer to have penpals. [Good point, but it could be more developed. What are the benefits of having penpals? How does this help us learn about other cultures and countries?]\n\nA penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. [This sentence is unclear and contains several errors. What does the student mean by \"you never and from another contry\"? Could they rephrase this sentence to make it clearer?

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

Additionally, the language use is unclear and confusing in some parts.\n\nAccording to the rubric, the student's response is missing key elements and lacks clarity, which falls under Score Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\nHere are some specific areas that need improvement:\n\n1. Lacks a clear thesis statement: The student does not provide a clear thesis statement that summarizes their main argument. Instead, they jump straight into discussing the positive and negative effects of computers without a clear direction.\n2. Limited supporting evidence: The student provides minimal evidence to support their claims about the effects of computers. For example, they mention playing video games and using the computer for research, but do not explain how these activities benefit or harm them.\n3. Disorganized structure: The student's response jumps between different topics, such as the benefits of hand-eye coordination and the negative effects of spending too much time on the computer. These ideas are not connected logically, making it difficult to follow the student's train of thought.\n4. Unclear language use: The student's language use is often unclear and confusing. For example, they use the phrase \"the computer is a nice outlit\" instead of \"outlet.\"\n\nBased on these issues, I would score the student's response as follows:\n\nSCORE: 1/6\n\nWhile the student attempts to take a position on the effects of computers, their response lacks clarity, organization, and supporting evidence. To improve their score, the student should focus on developing a clear thesis statement, providing more specific examples and evidence, and organizing their ideas in a logical and coherent manner.",

The reason why computers are so successful is because of the great information they provide, such as directions to a place, home information on a subject, or a person. However, some of the information on the internet may not be accurate, and there are risks such as spyware and pop-ups that can harm your computer. Computer games and online activities can also be harmful to children if they are not monitored. Lastly, email is a great way to communicate, but it can also be a source of stress if they are not managed properly.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I will assess the student's response point by point.\n\nScore Point 1: An undeveloped response that may take a position but offers no more than very minimal support.\n\n The student's response is somewhat developed, as they take a position on the positive and negative effects of computers.

The response is also somewhat fluent, with some transitional language and a clearer organization. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of persuasiveness and audience awareness. Score: 5/6\n\nScore Point 6: A well-developed response that takes a clear and thoughtful position and provides persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is not perfect, but it is the closest to a well-developed response among the options. They have provided fully elaborated reasons with specific details and examples, and the response is generally fluent and well-organized. The student has also shown a consistent awareness of the audience and has used sophisticated transitional language. Score: 5/6\n\nOverall, based on the provided rubric, I would give the student's response a score of 4/6. While the response is not perfect, it is a significant improvement from the previous points, and the student has demonstrated some understanding of the topic and the requirements of the prompt.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe.

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

Therefore, I would score this response as a 2, partially meeting the demands of the question.\n\nThe student mentions heat, abandoned roads, and snakes as reasons that affected the cyclist, which are all correct. However, the response lacks explanation and clarification of how these features of the setting specifically affect the cyclist. For instance, the student does not explain how the heat made the cyclist dehydrated or how the abandoned roads increased his doubt of completing the ride. Additionally, the response does not fully connect the support to a conclusion or assertion made about the text.\n\nFurthermore, the student's sentence structure and grammar are rather simple and could be improved. For example, the sentence \"Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist\" could be rephrased as \"The heat, abandoned roads, and snakes all adversely affected the cyclist.\" This would make the response more cohesive and easier to understand.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would award a score of 2 out of 3 to the student's response. While the response addresses the demands of the question, it lacks specific examples and explanation to support the conclusion, and the sentence structure and grammar could be improved.\n\nSCORE: 2/3",

However, the response lacks depth and detail, and the student's explanation of why the author concludes the story with that paragraph could be more developed.\n\nFirstly, the student correctly identifies that the author concludes the story with the paragraph about Saeng taking the test again in the spring because it is warmer and more fun. This is a good first step in understanding the conclusion of the story. However, the student does not fully explain why this is significant or how it relates to the rest of the story.\n\nSecondly, the student mentions that Saeng will have time to study in the winter for the spring test, but this is not explicitly stated in the text. While it is implied that Saeng may be preparing for the test, the student's response would be stronger if they had provided more evidence from the text to support this idea.\n\nThirdly, the student connects Saeng's understanding of the geese to the conclusion of the story, but this connection is not fully developed. The student simply states that Saeng \"finally understood what was going out\" and connects it to the geese return in the spring. A more detailed explanation of how Saeng's understanding of the geese relates to her decision to take the test again in the spring would strengthen the student's response.\n\nLastly, the student's response lacks clarity and organization. Some sentences are incomplete or lack clear connections to the previous or next ideas. The response would be more effective if it was more coherent and well-structured.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the text and could be improved by providing more evidence from the text, developing ideas more fully, and organizing the response more effectively.

Furthermore, the student's statement about the risk of collapse is not supported by evidence from the excerpt.\n\nTo improve their answer, the student could have provided more specific examples from the excerpt to support their claims. For instance, the excerpt states that the architects consulted with experts at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, to determine the best way to moor the dirigibles, and that the navy offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, for testing the mast. The student could have referenced these specific details to provide more context and support for their answer.\n\nOverall, the student's response is more suited to a score of 3, as it is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders faced. However, it lacks clarity, precision, and specific examples from the excerpt, which prevent it from achieving a score of 4.\n\nSCORE: 3/4.",

Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be \"modified and strengthened,\" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the \"mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose\". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were \"constantly shifting due to violent air currents\". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the response according to the score points:\n\nScore Point 4: The response is a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant and specific information from the excerpt.\n\nThe student's response is a clear and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant information from the excerpt, such as the need for modified and strengthened framework, safety concerns, and the use of hydrogen and unsafe wind conditions. However, to achieve a Score Point 4, the response should be even more comprehensive and specific.\n\nScore Point 3: The response is a mostly clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes relevant but often general information from the excerpt.\n\nWhile the student's response includes relevant information from the excerpt, it is not as comprehensive as a Score Point 3 response. The response could be more specific and offer more details about the obstacles the builders faced, such as the technical challenges of modifying the building's framework and the legal issues with airships flying low over populated areas.\n\nScore Point 2: The response is a partial description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes limited information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nThe student's response includes some limited information from the excerpt, but it also contains some misinterpretations and generalizations. For example, the response mentions \"foreign dirigibles\" made mostly of hydrogen, but the excerpt only refers to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Additionally, the response states that \"just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were constantly shifting,\" but this is not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt.\n\nScore Point 1: The response is a minimal description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The response includes little or no information from the excerpt and may include misinterpretations.\n\nWhile the student's response mentions some obstacles, it includes little relevant information from the excerpt and contains misinterpretations.

There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down.

The first problem or obsacle they faced was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They could not just drop a mooring mast on top, because it would cause stress towards the building that would spread to the foundation. The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone. Then the builders noticed that a great amount of dirigibles, from outside of the United States, were filled with hydrogen and not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey where a German dirigible got into an accident and was destroyed by fire, on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and thought about how New York is a highly populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have made on the civilians. The greatest obstacle that the builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast would be so the dirigibles would be force to swivel and move in every direction.

The ideas are clearly focused on the topic and are thoroughly developed with specific, relevant details. The student provides examples of how their family members are patient, such as their dad being deployed to a new country and their mom dealing with difficult coworkers. The student also includes specific details about their own experiences with patience, such as sitting on a long bus ride and waiting for school to end. Overall, the student's ideas are well-developed and thoroughly explored.\n\nOrganization (3 points):\n\nThe student's response is well-organized and logically sequenced. They begin by introducing the topic of patience and then provide examples of how their family is patient in different situations. The transitions between ideas and events are clear and logical, making it easy to follow the student's train of thought. However, there is room for improvement in terms of variability in sentence structure and length. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up to improve the flow of the text.\n\nStyle (3 points):\n\nThe student demonstrates a good command of language in their response. They use effective and compelling word choice and varied sentence structures to support their purpose and audience. For example, they use the phrase \"a long time\" to emphasize the duration of their dad's deployments and the word \"difficult\" to describe their mom's coworkers. The student also uses appropriate and varied sentence lengths to keep the text engaging and easy to read. However, there is room for improvement in terms of using more descriptive and vivid language to further engage the reader.\n\nConventions (3 points):\n\nThe student demonstrates consistent and appropriate use of conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation at the grade level. There are no major errors in these areas, and the student demonstrates a good understanding of how to use these conventions effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of using more precise and specific language to convey their ideas.\n\nOverall, I would award a score of 13/15 for this response. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic of patience and provides clear and well-developed examples of how their family is patient in different situations. The response is well-organized and logically sequenced, and the student demonstrates a good command of language and appropriate use of conventions. The only areas for improvement are in terms of sentence structure and length and using more descriptive and vivid language to further engage the reader.\n\nTherefore, the score I would assign is:\n\nSCORE: 13/15",

When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice!

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
