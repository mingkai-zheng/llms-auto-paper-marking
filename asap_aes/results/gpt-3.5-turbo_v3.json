There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

        "marker": "The student's response demonstrates several characteristics that align with different score points on the rubric. I will evaluate each aspect of the response and assign an appropriate score based on the given rubric criteria.\n\n1. Development of the response: The response is somewhat-developed as it includes reasons for supporting the positive effects of computers. The student mentions that computers teach hand-eye coordination, help learn about faraway places and people, and allow online communication with family and friends. However, the details provided are general and lacking in elaboration. The points made could have been supported with specific examples or further explanation. Score Point: 3/6\n\n2. Organization: The response shows some basic organization. The student starts with an introduction stating the opinion, presents three reasons supporting the opinion, and concludes by summarizing the main points. However, transitions between the reasons are weak, resulting in a somewhat awkward and fragmented flow. Score Point: 3/6\n\n3. Use of language: The response is written in a conversational tone but lacks clarity and coherence in some parts. There are multiple spelling errors, grammar mistakes, and incorrect punctuation, which hinder readability. The student could have improved the writing by proofreading and revising for clarity. Score Point: 2/6\n\n4. Support and details: While the response does offer reasons for supporting the positive effects of computers, the provided details are minimal and lack specificity. The student could have enhanced the argument by including specific examples or citing research to reinforce the claims made. Score Point: 2/6\n\n5. Awareness of audience: The response addresses the local newspaper and attempts to persuade readers. However, the lack of elaboration and weak support may not effectively convince the audience. The response could have been more targeted towards the concerns and interests of the newspaper's readership. Score Point: 2/6\n\nOverall, when considering the student's response in relation to the rubric criteria, the response mostly aligns with Score Point 2.

Frist of all, I think we should use computers because @CAPS2 we need help on something we can find it on the computer.

They provide three main reasons: finding help on the computer, getting in touch with others, and accessing important messages online. However, the response lacks coherency and organization. The student jumps between ideas without clear transitions. Additionally, the writing contains grammatical errors and is difficult to understand at times.\n\nStep 2: Determine the score point that best aligns with the student's response.\n\nThe student's response does not meet the criteria for Score Point 1, as it provides some support for their position. However, it also falls short of Score Point 2, as the reasons are general and unelaborated.

Given these factors, the student's response aligns most closely with Score Point 3.\n\nStep 3: Justify the assigned score by referencing the rubric.\n\nThe student's response includes reasons for their opinion, such as finding help on the computer and getting in touch with others. However, the details provided are minimal and lacking in specificity. For example, they mention using Google and a website called \"http.historywork.com,\" but do not explain how these resources provide assistance. The organization of the response is also weak, with abrupt transitions and fragmented sentences. The writing is awkward and disjointed, making it difficult for the reader to understand the student's points clearly. While there is some awareness of the audience evident in the use of second person pronouns, it is overshadowed by the lack of development and coherence in the response.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the student's response demonstrates minimal development, inadequate support, and lacks organization and clarity.

First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers.

For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17.

Lets find out what I have to say to these people who think that computers have a positive effect on people. People are so fat! Wounder why. Because they spend to much time on computers and less time exercising. Anyways @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 is obese. Concluding that some people die each year of being over weight. Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year. Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

However, these reasons are not adequately elaborated upon. For example, the student briefly mentions that spending too much time on computers leads to obesity but does not provide any further explanation or evidence to support this claim. Similarly, the mention of cramps is vague and lacks specificity in terms of how and why they occur. The same is true for sexual harassment and cyberbullying, with the student only briefly mentioning them without expanding on how computers contribute to these issues. \n\nThe organization of the response is somewhat satisfactory as the student attempts to discuss each reason separately. However, the overall flow of ideas is awkward and fragmented. The use of transition words and phrases is limited, making it difficult for the reader to follow the train of thought.\n\nAdditionally, the response contains several errors in grammar and syntax, which further detracts from the overall clarity and coherence. The use of all caps and the misuse of certain words, such as \"tip-top-tip-top\" and \"goin,\" contribute to the awkwardness and difficulty in understanding the response.\n\nOverall, while the student attempts to take a position and provide reasons, the lack of elaboration, poor organization, and frequent errors hinder the persuasiveness and effectiveness of their argument.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves.

They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

First of all computers can teach you all about the world without you having to go to a library appart for a book free sites like wikapedia provide fast knowledge and most anything, you can use @CAPS2 sites for essay, trip planning and just to satisfy your curiousity some people believe that computers @CAPS13 people from excersizing and enjoying nature however computers promote exercise and going out to look at nature computers provide quick and easy access to travel agencies, as well as information on popular tourist areas, in any reason, They also bring advertising sites for gyms and ideas on excersizing at home, Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks, they make @CAPS6 easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well, @CAPS3 can be much easier with the use of computers, @CAPS4 of dragging around heavy books, @CAPS5 can carry a small laptop; @CAPS5 also can @CAPS13 worrying about keeping track of papers.

Each @CAPS5 is given one to use @CAPS4 of books, \"@CAPS6 is so much easier\" said one student. @CAPS3 is very difficult for some kinds. Computers can make @CAPS6 simplier.

        "marker": "Review of the student's response:\n\nThe student's response is a persuasive letter to the local newspaper expressing their opinion on the effects of computers on people. The response begins with a clear introduction stating the benefits of computers, such as the ability to learn about faraway places, learn without carrying heavy books and papers, and communicate with people online. The student also addresses the counterargument that computers hinder exercise and enjoying nature, but argues that computers actually promote exercise and provide information on travel agencies and tourist areas. They further assert that computers make tasks like writing and organizing files easier, and argue that computers also facilitate communication and help bridge cultural gaps.\n\nHowever, the student's response has several significant issues that prevent it from scoring highly on the rubric. Firstly, the response contains numerous grammar and punctuation errors which make the writing difficult to read and understand. These errors, along with the frequent use of capitalization in inappropriate places (e.g., @CAPS1, @CAPS2, etc.), suggest a lack of attention to detail and hinder the overall coherence of the letter.\n\nSecondly, while the response attempts to address the counterargument, the development of this argument is weak and lacks specific details. The student briefly mentions that computers promote exercise and provide information on travel agencies and tourist areas, but does not provide any concrete examples or elaboration to support these claims. As a result, the response does not effectively counter the opposing viewpoint.\n\nThirdly, the response lacks organization and cohesiveness. The ideas are presented in a disjointed manner, and there is little logical progression or transitions between paragraphs. The lack of clear structure makes it difficult for the reader to follow the argument and undermines the persuasive intent of the letter.\n\nLastly, the response shows limited awareness of the audience. While the student addresses the readers of the local newspaper, they do not consider the potential concerns and viewpoints of the readers. A more effective response would have anticipated and addressed potential counterarguments in a more nuanced manner.\n\nBased on these assessments, I would assign this student's response a score of 2 out of 6.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",
        "marker": "This student's response can be evaluated as follows:\n\n1. The response is somewhat organized, with some attempt at an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. However, the organization is not strong, and there are no clear topic sentences or transitions between ideas. The lack of organization makes it difficult to follow the student's thoughts.\n\n2. The development of ideas is minimal. The student mentions three reasons why computers have a positive effect on people: providing needed information, allowing communication with friends and family around the world, and teaching new things. However, there is very little elaboration or specific details to support these reasons. The ideas are presented in a list-like fashion, lacking depth or complexity.\n\n3. The writing is awkward and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, making it difficult to read and understand. The errors suggest a lack of attention to detail and revision.\n\n4. The response shows some awareness of the audience, as the student attempts to persuade the readers of their opinion on the effects of computers. However, this is not consistently reflected in the writing, as the explanations are not well-developed or persuasive.\n\nBased on these observations, the student's response aligns most closely with Score Point 2: an under-developed response that may or may not take a position, with little elaboration or support. The response lacks organization, contains vague details, and is difficult to read and understand due to errors. The minimal development of ideas and lack of persuasive elements also contribute to the lower score.\n\nSCORE: 2/6",

        "essay": "Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese. We must take a stand and alter statistics for the better. Computers are ruining lives.",
        "marker": "Review:\n\nThe student's response to the question presents a clear position on the effects of computers on people. They argue that computers are destroying modern youth and causing emotional and physical harm. However, the response lacks development and adequate support for their claims.\n\nIn terms of organization, the response is somewhat fragmented and lacks coherence. There is no clear introduction or conclusion, and the ideas presented are not well-organized or connected. The response jumps between different arguments without transitioning smoothly between them. For example, the student talks about the dangers of social networks, then switches to discussing the physical impact of computers on children's health. This lack of organization makes the response confusing and difficult to follow.\n\nThe student's reasons and details are limited and lack elaboration. They briefly mention dangers such as cyberbullying and child predators but do not provide any specific examples or evidence to support their claims. When discussing the physical impact of computers on children's health, the student mentions statistics but does not provide any specific data or explain the sources of these statistics. This lack of specific details and evidence weakens the persuasive power of the response.\n\nFurthermore, the response shows little awareness of the audience. There is no attempt to address potential counterarguments or anticipate the concerns of the readers. The tone of the response is also overly emotional and lacks a logical and reasoned approach to persuading the readers.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I would assign this response a score point of 2, an under-developed response that may or may not take a position. The response lacks organization, provides minimal support, and shows little awareness of audience. \n\nSCORE: 2/6",

While this is true, the student does not provide any specific information from the excerpt to support this point.\n\nSecondly, the student briefly mentions that the mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose, but does not provide any reasoning or support for this claim. The student does not refer to the reasons mentioned in the excerpt, such as the use of hydrogen in dirigibles and the safety concerns associated with it, or the shifting winds on top of the building which made mooring difficult and unsafe.\n\nOverall, the response does not demonstrate a clear, complete, and accurate understanding of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It lacks specific and relevant evidence from the excerpt, and does not fully address the question.\n\nSCORE: 2/4",

According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the \"blimps\".

        "marker": "Student Answer:\n\nThere were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was too great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe.

These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.\n\nDetailed Review:\n\nThe student provides a clear and accurate description of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They correctly identify three main reasons: the safety concerns due to the flammable hydrogen used in dirigibles, the presence of violent air currents in New York City, and the legal restrictions on airships flying low over urban areas. The response also includes specific information from the excerpt, mentioning the fear of a Hindenburg repeat, the difficulty of docking in windy conditions, and the passing of a law restricting airships. Overall, the student's answer is well-supported and provides a complete description of the obstacles.\n\nRationale for the score:\n\nI would award this response a Score Point 4. The student's answer meets all the criteria for this score. They provide a clear, complete, and accurate description of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building.

Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened.

        "marker": "Review of Student's Response:\n\nThe student's response tells a story about a time when they were patient while waiting in line for a water roller coaster. The ideas presented in the story focus on the topic of patience and are developed with specific details, such as waiting in a long line and playing a game with their dad to pass the time. While the story does stay on topic and provides relevant details, there are some instances where the writing could be more focused and developed.\n\nIn terms of organization, the story follows a logical sequence of events. The student starts by explaining the situation of being in a long line and then proceeds to describe their actions and experiences while waiting. The connections between ideas and events are clear, but there are a few instances where transitions could be smoother to enhance the flow of the story.\n\nRegarding style, the student demonstrates a command of language with effective word choice and varied sentence structure. They use descriptive language, such as \"huge line\" and \"splashed into a huge amount of water,\" to engage the reader. However, there are some instances where the language could be more concise and precise to further support the purpose and audience of the writing.\n\nIn terms of conventions, the student generally follows the conventions of Standard English with consistent use of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. There are a few errors, such as capitalizing random words and misspelling words like \"easy\" and \"barely,\" but overall, the writing is clear and understandable.\n\nBased on the rubric, here is the breakdown of the scores:\n\nIdeas: Score 6 - The ideas are clearly focused on the topic of patience and are thoroughly developed with specific, relevant details.\n\nOrganization: Score 3 - The organization and connections between ideas and events are clear and logically sequenced. While there are some areas where transitions could be improved, the overall structure is effective.\n\nStyle: Score 3 - The student demonstrates a command of language with effective and compelling word choice and varied sentence structure. However, there is room for improvement in terms of conciseness and precision of language.\n\nConventions: Score 2 - The student shows adequate use of conventions of Standard English with some errors in grammar, spelling, and capitalization.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively tells a story about a time when they were patient. The writing could benefit from some improvements in organization and style, as well as more careful attention to conventions. \n\nSCORE: 14/15",

We went on the ride, and then all of a sudden the ride start, we didn\u0092t know and it only lasted @NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it.

        "marker": "Step-by-step review:\n\nIdeas:\nIn terms of ideas, the student tells a story about a time when they had to be patient while waiting in line for a roller coaster ride. The idea is clear and focused on the topic of patience. The student includes specific details such as calling their friends, packing water bottles, and waiting in line for hours. However, the development of the ideas is limited. The story lacks depth and complexity, and there is minimal exploration of the concept of patience. Therefore, I would award a score of 4 for this category.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the story is somewhat logical. The events are presented in a sequence, starting from calling friends and packing up to finally going on the ride. However, there are some abrupt transitions, and the story lacks clear connections between some of the events. Additionally, the introduction and conclusion are weak and do not effectively frame the story. Overall, the organization is somewhat sequenced, but there are weaknesses in the transitions and structure. I would give a score of 2 for this category.\n\nStyle:\nIn terms of style, the student demonstrates some command of language. The word choice is generally appropriate, and there is some use of varied sentence structure. However, the writing lacks sophistication and there are instances of repetitive phrasing. The language used is basic and does not effectively engage the reader. While the style is adequate for the writer's purpose and audience, it lacks the qualities of effective and compelling writing. I would award a score of 2 for this category.\n\nConventions:\nIn terms of conventions, the student demonstrates adequate use of Standard English. There are some errors in grammar, such as confusion between \"someone that's\" and \"someone that is,\" and in punctuation, such as missing commas in the dialogue. However, the errors do not significantly hinder comprehension, and the majority of the writing follows the conventions of Standard English at the grade level. I would give a score of 2 for this category.\n\nSCORE: 10/15",

        "marker": "Step-by-step Review:\n\nIdeas:\nThe student addresses the topic of patience by narrating a story about a time when they had to wait a long time for their food at a restaurant. They give specific details about how long they waited and the actions they took. However, the ideas lack depth and development. The story focuses solely on waiting for food at a restaurant without any explanation of why patience was required or the impact of their patience. The student could have provided more context and expanded on the significance of the situation. Therefore, I would award a score of 4.\n\nOrganization:\nThe student's story is somewhat logically sequenced. They begin by describing their plane ride and checking in, before moving on to the main part of the story, which is waiting for their meal at the restaurant. The events are connected in a clear chronological order. However, the introduction and conclusion are weak, as they do not provide any closure or reflection on the experience. The organization could have been improved with a stronger introduction and a conclusion that wraps up the story. Therefore, I would award a score of 2.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's use of language is adequate. They use simple and straightforward sentences to relay the events of the story. Their word choice is basic and lacks variety, which hinders the engagement of the reader. The narrative style could have been more engaging and descriptive. Additionally, the student missed some opportunities to enhance the story with dialogue or sensory details. Therefore, I would award a score of 2.\n\nConventions:\nThe student demonstrates an adequate use of conventions of Standard English. There are some errors in grammar, punctuation, and capitalization, such as inconsistent use of capital letters and missing punctuation marks. However, the errors do not significantly hinder comprehension. The student's writing could benefit from more careful proofreading to improve the overall clarity.

        "essay": "I\u0092m constantly patient moioly because of my younger sister. Sometimes its easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I\u0092m able to manage. I think this is a great example. One chilly @DATE1 @TIME1 I was in my mothers room and I saw her doing her make-up. I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
