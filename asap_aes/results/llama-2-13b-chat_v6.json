There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers.

I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

        "essay": "Dear Local Newspaper, I am here to tell you the negative effect on people because of computer usage. How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe.

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time.

Therefore, I would award a score of 2 out of 6 for this criterion.\n\nScore Point 3: A minimally-developed response that may take a position, but with inadequate support and details.\n\nThe student's response is minimally developed, as they fail to provide adequate support and details for their claims. The response is largely based on personal opinions and anecdotes, without any concrete evidence or research to back up their arguments. However, the student does show some awareness of audience and attempts to address potential counterarguments. Therefore, I would award a score of 3 out of 6 for this criterion.\n\nScore Point 4: A somewhat-developed response that takes a position and provides adequate support.\n\nThe student's response is somewhat developed, as they provide some adequate support and details for their claims. The response is structured around a clear argument, and the student provides some specific examples and evidence to back up their points. However, the response is still somewhat awkward and lacks fluency, and the student could benefit from more transitional language and organization. Therefore, I would award a score of 4 out of 6 for this criterion.\n\nScore Point 5: A developed response that takes a clear position and provides reasonably persuasive support.\n\nThe student's response is developed, as they provide a clear and well-structured argument with moderately well-elaborated reasons and specific details. The response is fluent and uses some sophisticated transitional language, and the student shows a consistent awareness of audience. However, the response could benefit from more concrete data and research to further support their claims. Therefore, I would award a score of 5 out of 6 for this criterion.\n\nScore: 5/6\n\nOverall, the student's response is developed and takes a clear position, but could benefit from more concrete evidence and organization to further support their claims. The response is somewhat fluent and shows a consistent awareness of audience, but could benefit from more sophisticated transitional language and more nuanced arguments.",

For example, the question asks about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but the student's response focuses mainly on the problems the cyclist faced, such as taking directions from the old-timers and running out of water. While these points are valid, they do not fully address all the features of the setting and how they affected the cyclist.

They mention specific details from the story, such as the old-timers' directions and the protagonist's dehydration. However, the student does not fully clarify and extend their understanding beyond the literal, as required by the rubric. SCORE: 2/3\n\nPart 3: Clarifying and extending understanding beyond the literal\n\nHere, the student's response falls short. While they mention some explicit details from the text, they do not provide a clear and extended analysis of how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The response remains at a literal level and does not demonstrate a full understanding of the text's complexities. SCORE: 1/3\n\nBy analyzing the response based on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 2/3.

However, the response does not fully address the question's demand of explaining why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Instead, the student provides a limited explanation that focuses primarily on the changing seasons and Saeng's desire to study for the test.\n\nThe response does use some expressed and implied information from the text, such as the reference to the geese and their annual return. However, the connection between the geese and Saeng's decision to retake the test is not fully developed. The student simply states that Saeng will take the test again in the spring, without fully explaining how the geese are connected to this decision.\n\nAdditionally, the response lacks clarity and extension of understanding beyond the literal. The student does not consider other possible motives for Saeng's decision to retake the test, such as her desire to understand her new surroundings or to prove to herself that she can succeed.

The building's steel frame would have to be modified for the building to be able to withstand the mooring mast alone.

The language does not effectively support the writer's purpose and audience. SCORE: 1/3\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions of Standard English is inconsistent and contains errors. There are errors in grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. SCORE: 1/3\n\nTOTAL SCORE: 4/15\n\nBased on the rubric and the student's response, I would give the student a score of 4/15. The student's answer does not meet the criteria for a strong response, as it does not focus on the topic of patience, lacks a clear organization, and uses limited and ineffective language. Additionally, there are several errors in conventions of Standard English.\n\nIn my feedback to the student, I would highlight the areas of strength and weakness and provide specific suggestions for improvement. For example, I might suggest that the student focus on a specific story or example that illustrates patience, and provide more detailed and relevant information about the topic. Additionally, I might suggest that the student work on improving their language use, including adding more variety to their sentence structure and using more effective word choice.",

Here's a step-by-step review of their response, along with my rationale for the grade I assign.\n\nIdeas (6 points):\nThe student's answer tells a story about a time when they were patient, which is clearly focused on the topic. However, the ideas are somewhat underdeveloped, with limited specific details to support the story. The student does provide a few examples of situations where they had to be patient, such as waiting for someone to finish using the bathroom or waiting for their turn on a computer. However, these examples are brief and lack depth.\n\nOrganization (3 points):\nThe student's answer is somewhat logically sequenced, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the transitions between ideas and events are weak, and the story jumps abruptly from one scenario to the next. The student could benefit from more connective language to tie their ideas together and create a smooth flow of information.\n\nStyle (2 points):\nThe student's answer demonstrates adequate command of language, with effective word choice and clear sentences. However, the writing lacks variation in sentence structure, which makes it sound a bit flat and monotonous. Additionally, there are a few minor grammar errors, such as the use of \"cause\" instead of \"because\" in one place.\n\nConventions (3 points):\nThe student's answer consistently uses appropriate conventions of Standard English for grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation for the grade level. However, there are a few minor errors, such as missing articles and incorrect verb tenses in a few places.\n\nOverall, based on the provided rubric, I would score the student's answer as follows:\n\nSCORE: 8/15\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates some strengths in idea development and language use, but could benefit from more detailed examples and improved organization and conventions.

However, the ideas are not thoroughly developed with specific, relevant details. For example, the student mentions that they and their cousins had to wait for their grandma to wake up, but they don't provide any details about what they did during that time or how they felt about waiting. Additionally, the student does not clearly convey the concept of patience in their story.\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's answer is somewhat logically sequenced, but the connections between ideas and events are not always clear. For example, the student jumps from talking about waiting for their grandma to suddenly noticing that their grandparents were carrying suitcases. The transitions between ideas could be smoother and more cohesive.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but it could be more effectively varied to support their purpose and audience. For example, the student uses repetitive phrases like \"so we could\" and \"so we went\" that make the story sound a bit robotic and lacking in emotional depth.\n\nConventions:\n\nThe student's use of conventions is generally consistent and appropriate for their grade level. However, there are a few minor errors in spelling and punctuation that could be corrected.\n\nBased on these evaluations, I would give the student's answer a score of 4 out of 15.

I asked \u0093@CAPS1 did you get @CAPS5 good at putting make-up?\u0094 @CAPS2 responded \u0093with patience and years of practice.\u0094 The next day when I had gotten an allowance, I asked my mom \u0093@CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ORGANIZATION1, later?\u0094 @CAPS2 replies \u0093@CAPS4, @CAPS9?\u0094 I answered \u0093@CAPS5 I can get some make-up to practice with\u0094. \u0093@CAPS6.\u0094 @CAPS2 says. When we get there, there\u0092re @CAPS5 many choices to chose from! I asked my mom to help me select the best ones! After we check out; its time to go home and practice! Sadly my first lesson in make-up didn\u0092t go to great, but I did ask my mom for some help and @CAPS2 said \u0093@CAPS8, I know you\u0092ll catch on soon!\u0094 and I wondered out loud \u0093@CAPS9?,\u0092 @CAPS2 almost said as a whisper \u0093because any can pay someone else to do their make-up and hair, but almost no one can or will take the time and patients to learn it their self.\u0094",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",
