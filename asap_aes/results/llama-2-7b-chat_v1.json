The student provides some reasons to support their argument, but their response is not well-developed, and they fail to provide persuasive support to convince the readers. Here is a detailed analysis of the student's response and the reasons why I graded it as follows:\n1. Contains few or vague details: The student provides some reasons why computers are beneficial, such as teaching hand-eye coordination, giving people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and allowing people to talk online with other people. However, these reasons are not well-elaborated, and the student fails to provide specific examples or cases to support their argument. Therefore, this criterion scores a 1.\n2. Is awkward and fragmented: The student's response is fragmented, and they jump between different ideas without a clear organization. They use phrases like \"For this reason I think that @CAPS4 should take the advantige\" without providing a clear connection between the previous ideas and the conclusion. Therefore, this criterion scores a 2.\n3. May be difficult to read and understand: The student's writing is not clear and concise, and they use some sentences that are difficult to understand. For example, they write \"like sendding emails or talking on ooVoo\" without explaining what these words mean. Therefore, this criterion scores a 3.\n4. May show no awareness of audience: The student does not consider the audience of their letter and does not adjust their language or tone accordingly. They use technical terms like \"hand-eye coordination\" and \"ooVoo\" without explanation, which may confuse the readers who are not familiar with these terms. Therefore, this criterion scores a 4.\n5. Using language that is appropriate for the audience: The student's language is not appropriate for the audience of the letter, which is the general public. They use technical terms and assume that the readers are familiar with these terms. Therefore, this criterion scores a 1.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I awarded a score of 4/6. The student's response is not well-developed, and they fail to provide persuasive support to convince the readers of the benefits of computers.

With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

However, the response does not offer persuasive support for this position beyond these general points.\nHere are some areas where the response could be improved:\n1. Elaboration of reasons: While the student mentions some benefits of using computers, such as helping with tasks and allowing for communication, these points are not adequately elaborated. The response could benefit from more specific and detailed explanations of how computers can help with tasks, as well as examples of how communication through computers can be useful.\n2.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",
        "marker": " SCORE: 2/6\nAfter a detailed review of the student's response, I have determined that it falls within the second score point category, which is an under-developed response that may or may not take a position. The student provides some reasons why computers are beneficial, but these reasons are not well-elaborated and lack specific details.\nThe student's first reason for why computers are beneficial is that they teach hand-eye coordination. While this is a legitimate benefit, the student does not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support this claim. Similarly, the student's second reason is that computers allow people to learn about faraway places and people, but again, this is a general statement that needs to be backed up with specific examples.\nThe student's third reason is that computers help kids get their work done faster. This is a somewhat valid point, but it could be further developed by providing evidence of how computers can improve productivity and efficiency. The student's final reason is that computers provide another source of communication, which is a valid point but could be expanded upon to include more details about the various communication platforms available on computers.\nOverall, while the student provides some reasons why computers are beneficial, these reasons are not well-elaborated and lack specific details. As a result, I have awarded a score of 2/6.\nRATIONALE:\nThe student's response does not address the prompt in a clear and persuasive manner. The reasons provided are not well-elaborated and lack specific details, which makes them difficult to accept as valid arguments. Additionally, the student does not appear to consider the potential drawbacks of increased reliance on technology, which is a critical aspect of any persuasive argument.\nIn contrast, a well-developed response would have provided more detailed and specific examples of the benefits of computers, as well as a thoughtful consideration of the potential drawbacks. This would have allowed the writer to present a more balanced and persuasive argument.\nTo improve the student's response, I would encourage them to provide more specific details and examples to support their claims, as well as a more thoughtful consideration of the potential drawbacks of increased reliance on technology.

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

However, the student does not provide any specific examples or evidence to support these claims, which reduces the validity of their argument. Therefore, I docked 0.5 points in this category.\n2. Clarity and coherence (2 points): The student's response is largely coherent, but there are some signs of awkwardness in their writing. For instance, they use informal language such as \"you my opionun\" and \"giving you pearsonal imformation.\" Additionally, the student jumps between different ideas within the response without connecting them logically, which makes it difficult to follow their argument. Hence, I deducted 0.5 points in this category.\n3. Organization and structure (2 points): The student's response has some semblance of an outline, with introductory paragraph, middle paragraph, and concluding sentence. However, the organization is not well-executed, and the student jumps between different ideas without a clear connection between them. Additionally, the student could have provided more transitional phrases to link their ideas together smoothly. Therefore, I deducted 0.5 points in this category.\n4. Language and conventions (1 point): The student's response contains errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, which detracts from their argument. For instance, they write \"inferm\" instead of \"inform,\" and \"cominication\" instead of \"communication.\" These errors are not severe, but they affect the readability and credibility of the response. Therefore, I awarded 0.5 points in this category.\n5. Supporting evidence and examples (1 point): The student does not provide any evidence or examples to support their arguments, which makes their claims appear unsubstantiated. Although they mention some positive effects of computers, they do not provide any quantifiable data or real-world examples to back them up. Therefore, I awarded 0.5 points in this category.\nBased on the above assessment, I award the student a score of 4 out of 6. The student shows some understanding of the topic and attempts to present their position, but their writing is not yet persuasive or well-developed. With more practice and attention to detail, they can improve their writing and make a more convincing argument.",

Say you don\u0092@CAPS2 have a car. Well you can go online and buy whatever you need at the store. People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games. You can go online find what you want click buy and chose your shipping. That is why I think computers are helpful. Chatting on the computer is great. Now facebook, @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 are the social networking sites that rate the @CAPS15. On @CAPS6 you can follow famous people like @PERSON1 the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 receicer. Facebook has fan pages for famous people. @CAPS7 might actually have famous people accounts. Chatting become something that almost @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS13 uses. you @MONTH1 believe its pointless but almost the whole @CAPS13 uses it. You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17. Also you can buy @ORGANIZATION1 league @CAPS18 or @ORGANIZATION2. @CAPS17 and you can watch live sports games from your computer. This is also easier when maybe your in the car for a long road trip then you turn on your laptop and watch any show you @MONTH1 went @CAPS17 on the go is technology at its higher point.

Think of it this way baseball players and so on can get about @NUM1 to @MONEY1 a year, isn't that what you want to be millionaires? Isn't nature so great when you exsperiance it? Well I think so because people don't think before choping down trees. Think about the animals don't you think they get enough torrocher evey year.

Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder.

        "marker": " SCORE: 2/6\nThe student's response takes a clear position on the effects of computers on people, arguing that computers are bad for society and can lead to health problems, environmental damage, and social isolation. However, the response fails to provide adequate support and reasons to back up these claims.\nHere are the issues with the response:\n1. Lack of detail: The student provides very little detail to support their claims. For example, they simply state that people are becoming obese from spending too much time on computers without providing any data or research to back up this claim.\n2. Lack of organization: The response jumps between different topics without any clear structure or flow. The student transitions between topics using awkward phrases like \"Anyways\" and \"Well, I think so,\" which makes the response difficult to follow.\n3. Lack of awareness of audience: The student does not consider the audience or address any counterarguments. They simply state their opinion without acknowledging any potential concerns or perspectives of others.\nDespite these issues, the student does provide some minor insights into the potential negative effects of computers on society. For example, they mention the environmental impact of computer production and disposal, and the potential for social isolation caused by spending too much time online. However, these insights are not developed or supported with evidence, and therefore do not contribute to a persuasive argument.\nBased on the provided rubric, I award the student a score of 2/6. The response shows some minimal understanding of the topic and takes a clear position, but fails to provide adequate support or organization. To improve this response, the student could:\n1. Provide more specific and detailed evidence to support their claims.\n2. Develop a clearer structure and organization, using transitional language to connect ideas.\n3. Consider the audience and address any potential counterarguments.\nBy addressing these areas of improvement, the student can develop a more persuasive and well-supported argument on the effects of computers on society.",

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect.

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation. The computer allows for quick and beneficial research. The computer hasn't been in use for that long and it is already helping society expand & grow. It provides a social aspect where you can talk to friends & family. You can provide yourself with the lastest news & stories, and you can do quick & easy research. A computer without a doubt has a positive effect on society and we as people. The experts can say what they want, but the computer is and always will be benefit to society.",

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",

I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",

The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. \"I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live.\" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse. The social networks that modern technology promotes harvest cases like @PERSON1's. If this rapid increase in technology continues then we will see many more cases such as that one. In the past year, @NUM1 @CAPS1-bully victim have committed suicide. Those are @NUM1 lives that could have been saved; @NUM1 families that could still be together. This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers.

Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day. In @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer and @PERCENT3 outside. Over the past @NUM4 years these numbers have headed south due to tha advance in technology. These numbers prove that computers have dictated obese children's day, making their physical condition even worse. Computers are to blame for our worlds weight issues. As I conclude this letter, I can only hope that I persuated you to make a stand and hault this technological advancement. In conclusion, computers are harvesting @CAPS1-@CAPS2 which leads to emotional discomfort. They also dictate time, and as a result, children become obese.

        "marker": " After reviewing the student's response, I have awarded the following score: SCORE: 3/6. Here is my detailed evaluation of the response, along with references to the rubric:\nThe student's response takes a clear position on the topic, arguing that computers are harmful to society and leading to various negative consequences, such as obesity and emotional distress. However, the response is under-developed and lacks persuasive support. Below are the areas where the response falls short and the corresponding rubric scores:\n1. Contains few or vague details (Score Point 1): The student provides very limited examples and details to support their argument, which makes their points less convincing. For instance, they mention \"a former student of @ORGANIZATION1\" without providing any specific details about the student's experience or the harm they suffered. Rubric score: 1.\n2. Shows little evidence of organization (Score Point 2): The response meanders without a clear structure or transitions, making it difficult to follow the student's argument. The student jumps between different topics, such as the dangers of obesity and the advancement of technology, without connecting them coherently. Rubric score: 2.\n3. May be awkward and confused or simplistic (Score Point 3): The student's language and sentence structure are often simplistic and unclear, which hinders their ability to convey their message effectively. For example, they use phrases like \"in @DATE1, children spent @PERCENT2 of their day in front of a computer\" without provided any context or explanation. Rubric score: 3.\n4. May show little awareness of audience (Score Point 4): The student's argument appears to be aimed at a general audience, but they lack specific details or examples that would resonate with a particular audience. For instance, their statement \"Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse\" lacks concrete evidence or data to support this claim. Rubric score: 3.\nGenerally, the student's response could benefit from more detailed and persuasive reasoning, as well as a clearer structure and organization. To improve their grade, the student could expand on their arguments, provide more specific examples and evidence, and use more sophisticated language and transitional devices.",

        "marker": " Student's Answer:\nThe cyclist is affected in various ways by the setting in \"Rough Road Ahead\" by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting creates a sense of danger and uncertainty, which is evident in the cyclist's experience. For example, the old codgers' advice to take a shortcut leads to the cyclist encountering a \"ghost town\" and a \"breezy jaunt\" that turns out to be a \"shortcut\" that adds hours to his ride to Yosemite National Park. This experience shows how the setting can mislead and deceive the protagonist, leading to unfortunate consequences.\nFurthermore, the setting also affects the cyclist's physical and mental state. The \"midday sun [beating] down\" and the \"cool pines and rushing rivers\" of Yosemite create a contrast with the \"flat road\" and \"short, rolling hills\" of the \"rough road ahead.\" This contrast highlights the difficulties and challenges that the cyclist faces on his journey. Additionally, the cyclist's dehydration and fear of heatstroke demonstrate the physical toll of the setting on the protagonist.\nThe setting also has an emotional impact on the cyclist. The encounter with the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory and the image of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth create a sense of longing and loss. This longing is intense enough to make the cyclist consider kissing Gary and Wilber, despite not owning a rod or reel, highlighting the emotional impact of the setting on the protagonist.\nIn conclusion, the setting of \"Rough Road Ahead\" significantly affects the cyclist's experience, leading to dangerous situations, physical and mental challenges, and emotional longing. The cyclist's encounter with the abandoned factory and the image of the young boy pouring juice into his mouth demonstrate the impact of the setting on the protagonist's emotional state.

However, the student does not provide any further analysis or examples from the text to support their answer.\nFirstly, the student could have used the example of the old men giving the cyclist wrong directions as a feature of the setting that affects the cyclist's journey. The passage notes that the old men \"spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt\" were incorrect, and this misdirection led the cyclist onto a longer and more challenging route. This example illustrates how the setting can impact the cyclist's progress and goals, as the wrong directions led to a longer journey than expected.\nSecondly, the student could have analyzed the effect of the heat on the cyclist. The passage notes that the cyclist is \"feeling sorry for himself\" and has \"dehydrated state,\" indicating that the hot weather is taking a toll on the cyclist's physical well-being.

The passage notes that the cyclist is \"hanging his head\" and feels \"cruel\" after realizing that he has been led astray by the old men. The student could have discussed how the isolation and desolation of the setting add to the cyclist's feelings of hopelessness and frustration.\nIn conclusion, while the student's response acknowledges one of the ways in which the setting affects the cyclist, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the text to support their answer.

They provide examples from the text, such as the cyclist's slow pace and lack of water, and the sign that seems to mock him, to support their argument. However, the response falls short of a full understanding in several areas.\nFirstly, the student does not fully connect the support to a conclusion or assertion made about the text. For example, the student states that the features of the setting are affecting the cyclist, but does not explain how this is evident in the text. They simply provide examples without linking them to a broader argument.\nSecondly, the student may not fully understand the implications of the text. For instance, they mention that the cyclist is getting weaker, but do not consider the potential consequences of this in the context of the story. The cyclist could be in danger of serious injury or even death if he does not find water and rest soon.\nLastly, the student may have misread the sign as mocking the cyclist, when in fact it is simply warning him of the rough road ahead. This misreading does not affect the overall grade, but it does demonstrate a limited understanding of the text.\nBased on these limitations, I assign the student a score of 2/3.

The mood in his home is always happy, and thankful,\" the response does not provide specific examples or quotes from the memoir to support this claim. While it is clear that the author is grateful for his parents' sacrifices, there is no direct evidence in the passage to suggest that the mood of the house is always happy and thankful. Therefore, I will deduct a score of 2.\nMoving on to the second point, the student states, \"Narciso was always talking positve, never about what is bad in his life.\" While it is true that the author does not dwell on negative aspects of his life in the passage, there is no explicit mention of Narciso always talking positively. The student could have used more specific language to convey this idea. Thus, I will deduct another point.\nThe third point is almost accurate: \"Narciso's mood is set in the excerpt from his memoirs.\" However, the student should have said \"the mood of the passage\" instead of \"Narciso's mood\" to be more accurate. Therefore, I will deduct another point.\nThe last point is incorrect: \"Narciso's home is created.\" Based on the passage, it is clear that the author's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country and where Narciso celebrated his first birthdays. Therefore, the correct statement would be \"The author's home is created.\"\nBased on these evaluations, I will award the student a score of 1/4.\nSCORE: 1/4",

Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.\" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even \"swivel around the mooring mast.\" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

First was that the building itself needed to get stronger in order to support \"a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building\" As a result, the frame of the Empire State Building needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the problem. According to the excerpt, @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the building's framework. Another problem was that of the stress of the wind pressure The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. This was also solved, at least they thought, by making a few changes to the skeleton of the building. Lastly, was that the building needed a space to provide for passengers that were to come from the \"blimps\".

Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be \"modified and strengthened,\" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the \"mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose\". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were \"constantly shifting due to violent air currents\". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas.

Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.",

The student correctly identifies the three main reasons why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast: safety concerns due to the use of hydrogen, violent air currents in the area, and a law passed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. The student also supports their answer with evidence from the excerpt, such as the reference to the Hindenburg disaster and the captain's decision to cancel the publicity stunt due to Forceful winds.\nOne aspect of the student's answer that deserves particular mention is their clear and accurate explanation of the safety concerns related to the use of hydrogen. The student acknowledges that hydrogen is highly flammable, which was a major concern given the Hindenburg disaster. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the context and a nuanced interpretation of the excerpt.\nThere are no major errors or misinterpretations in the student's answer, and they provide a well-structured and detailed explanation of the obstacles facing the Empire State Building's mooring mast.

        "essay": "The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that they faced concerned safety. Many dirigibles from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and if it were to catch fire of New York City the results could be horrific. Another obstacle the builders faced concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building the wind became a major factor. Wind currents were constantly shifting and if a dirigible was attached to it, it would be unsafe. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building would have to be strengthened. Another obstacle concerned law. There is a law that states that airships can not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship up to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there.",

Here is my detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response:\nIdeas (4/6): The student tells a story about their younger sister, which is somewhat focused on the topic of patience. The student describes a situation where their sister struggles to put on makeup and how the student is patient with her. However, the story could be more focused on the topic of patience, as it primarily revolves around the sister's difficulty with makeup. The student could have explored the concept of patience more thoroughly, using specific details and examples to illustrate their point.\nOrganization and Connections (3/3): The student's response is well-organized, with clear transitions between ideas and events. The connections between the ideas and events are logical and easy to follow. However, the student could have taken it a step further by creating more connections between the different parts of the story, making it more cohesive and engaging.\nStyle (3/3): The student's use of language is clear and concise, with effective word choice and varied sentence structure. The student uses active voice effectively and avoids grammatical errors. However, the student could have used more descriptive language and varied sentence structure to make the response more engaging and interesting.\nConventions (3/3): The student uses conventions of Standard English accurately and consistently throughout the response. The student shows a good understanding of grammar, usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation for their grade level.\nBased on this evaluation, I award the student a score of 9/15.\nSCORE: 9/15",

        "essay": "Patience is something that people don't have sometimes. I know I did once. And I 'm gonna tell you about it. It was a bright sunny day. All my family members were outside. My dad making hot dogs and hamburgers in the grill. My mom setting up the table. And me and my sibling playing catch with a football. All of us knew how to throw and catch a football but not my little brother. Considering the fact that all of us were chose to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just wouldn't get the hang of it. Finally all my sisters got tired of explaining him the object of the game, so they gave up. Me, on the other side said it over and over until he understood it. I myself got tired of telling him over and what to do. But then I thought 'hey give the kid a chance he might just get it 'so I just kept on helping him. \"@CAPS1 is ready! Come inside\", my mom had called out. \"Time for @CAPS1 lets go inside\" I said to my little brother. \"@CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I will get it!\" he exclaimed. \"@CAPS3, but just one time\" I responded. Even tho he had been saying that the past few hundred times he'd tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it once more. As I released the ball from hands my brother ran up to it and caught it! After he caught it he shouted \"I did it\" and I looked at him proudly and said \"good job\" he ran inside to tell my parents that he finally caught it. I was really alod that I had token the time to help him. I knew he could do it @CAPS2 matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that was the time I was patient.",

Ideas: The student successfully tells a story about a time when they were patient. They provide a clear and concise narrative that effectively conveys the message of patience. The story is well-developed and includes specific details that help to illustrate the student's experience.\n2. Organization: The student's response is well-organized and easy to follow. The ideas are logically sequenced, making it clear how the student's patience helped them to persevere in their efforts to teach their little brother how to catch a football.\n3. Style: The student demonstrates a good command of language, using effective and compelling word choices and varied sentence structures throughout their response. Their writing is clear and concise, making it easy for the reader to understand their message.\nWeaknesses:\n1. Ideas: While the student's story is well-developed, it lacks focus on the topic of patience. The story could benefit from more explicit connections to the topic, such as how the student's patience helped them to understand their little brother's perspective or how it influenced their attitude towards the task.\n2. Conventions: While the student's response is generally well-written, there are some conventions errors throughout. For example, there are a few instances of indefinite pronouns (e.g. \"one time\") that are not clearly defined, and there are some inconsistencies in the use of capitalization and punctuation.\nRationale: Based on the provided rubric, I have awarded the student a score of 9/15. While the student's response demonstrates some strengths in terms of ideas and organization, it could benefit from more focus on the topic of patience and more attention to conventions. Overall, the student's response is competent but could be improved with more attention to detail and a clearer connection to the topic.",
