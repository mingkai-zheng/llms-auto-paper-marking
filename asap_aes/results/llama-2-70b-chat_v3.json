With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world.

You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy.

Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",

        "essay": "Dear @PERSON1 editor, I think that the computers have both positive and negative effects, but more positive. For example, when people get home from work or school, they immedlatly go on the computer, to check email, do work, or to play games. I think that it's good to connect with friends and learn about the far away nature and people that we cant see, but too much of it will be bad. I know it will be bad because it can cause a lack of exercise and the computer can cut you off from your family and friends if you're on it too much, I think it's good to go on the computer for a limited amount of time each day, but also spend time outside with family and friends. The computer is good because of all the extrodinary things it offers and the things you can learn. I myself like to play video games on it like bubble spinner but at the same time I'll be on facebook, facebook lets me connect with friends and family while bubble spinner helps with hand-eye coordination, when projects came along I usually do all my research there, picking up information on each site. I also do all the writing on it too so it wont look messy but instead, clean and neat. The computer also offers video of pretty much anything on t.v. and otherwise, like youtube or google videos. The computer lets me see nature, talk to friends and family, and lets me see things, like videos, that twill never ever see in books. These show that the computer has a bigger positive impact than negative and we should take advantage of the new technology that we have and not let it go to waste. The computer is a nice outlit to come home and let yourself unwind to. People say that you don't get enough exercise but we have gym and recess at school and we become exhausted at work, which is enough exercise for the day. Computers are a nice device to have and are by far, used daily by almost everyone. So it can't be all that bad by depriving you from nature and family because it lets you see it anyway. The effects it has on people are good because of the knowledge and communication it brings. I hope you see my point of view.",

People is a function that @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 does where you order your @CAPS5 online and they drop it off. Say you need clothes or shoes or maybe even games.

You can also use webcam @CAPS1 where you can actually see the person talking to you and they own see you. @CAPS1 also is good if your always on the go and you cant talk on the phone then you send messages in @CAPS1. this is why I find @CAPS1 as such a neccessity. @CAPS17 is a new thing that has recently hit the @CAPS13 @CAPS11 @CAPS15. there are sites such as @LOCATION1 can or @CAPS16 @CAPS17.

        "essay": "In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",

How would you react if you didn't have the time to exercise, enjoy nature or spend time with family and friends? Well some people don't notice that they are losing the time to do that stuff due to using the computer. No time to exercise? What does that mean? I can see these questions flying through heads of great people. No time to exercise means exactly what it sounds like, which is, since people every day are wasting their time on the computer playing games, chatting with people, ect. They don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise. What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature? I know I do. Since time flys when people are on the computer, which sometimes they don't realize, they would probaly be thinking I never got to go outside and go for a walk through the forest and enjoy the nature. Well @CAPS1'll do that sometimes, but the truth is when people say stuff like that, it doesn't help to motivate themselves, its basically saying I'll go for a nature walk tomorrow and if that doesn't happen I'll just have to do it the next day. Odds are that the person saying that won't actually go for a walk they will thinks its going to be okay and they will just keep pulling it off. What ever happened to spending time with family and friends? Oh I know, I know, all of family and friend time was wasted into being on the computer. people don't realize that since their time is being wasted into the computer and that they don't even have time to sit down talk to their family, have fun, go out with friends to catch a movie or something. As you have heard, more and more people are using computers, which I believe has a negative effect on them because they don't have time for exercising, enjoying nature, talking with family and friends ect. All of the time being spent on the computer is replacing the time for that stuff, and its not a good thing. Computers have a negative effect on people and I say we should find a way to cut down computer time.",
        "marker": " The student's response is very passionate and emotive, but it lacks clarity, sophistication, and persuasive evidence to support their stance.\n\nAt first glance, the response seems to meet the criteria for a score of 4, as it takes a clear position and provides some reasons to support it. However, upon closer examination, the response falls short in several areas.\n\nFirstly, the reasons provided are very general and lack specific details. For example, the response states that computers are taking away time from exercise, nature, and socializing, but there is no concrete evidence or statistics to support these claims. The response also jumps between different ideas without a clear structure or organization, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought.\n\nSecondly, the response lacks sophistication in its language and transitional phrases. There are several instances of awkward phrasing, such as \"What about nature? Are you a person who likes to enjoy nature?\" or \"they don't get to do what they really want to do which is most of the time exercise.\" These phrases detract from the overall quality of the response and make it harder to take the writer's argument seriously.\n\nLastly, there is no clear awareness of the audience in the response. The writer does not address the reader directly or acknowledge the potential counterarguments that might arise from the audience. This lack of awareness suggests that the writer is not fully invested in persuading the reader of their position.\n\nGiven these limitations, I would give the response a score of 3 out of 6. The writer's passion and conviction are evident, but the lack of specific details, sophistication in language, and audience awareness hold the response back from being truly persuasive.\n\nSCORE: 3/6",

        "essay": "Dear Newspaper of @LOCATION1, The use of the computer is a controversial topic. Many people have varying opinions & beliefs, But I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on the people who use & operate them. These remarkable devices give people the ability to talk & be social with friends and family members. They let people know what is going on in the world, and give updates on the condition of countries and events. They will also provide information, and give people the ability to research and learn more about a topic or idea. A computer is a necessity in todays society, & to go against it is a proposterous motion. Many people young & old are starting to use the computer to be social with friends & family members through various types of websites & programs. A computer is to talk to someone without physically being there. The social aspect of a computer is rising in popularity and many people are using computers to be social. Social networking sites, and instant messaging programs are just two at the many ways to be socially active on a computer. A social networking site as a website that allows you to make an account and post pictures and information for your friends to see. To take away the computer would take away many peoples social lives. The computer benefits many people socially and this has a positive effect on their lives. Todays news is always with exciting events and horrible disaters that many people like to be updated with. Most people do not like to wait for the newspaper to arrive to read about the fastest news. So they check online and find about it there. Online news is widely popular & extremely beneficial to many people. It provides them with the lastest stories and updated events. Online news was extremely crucial in the lastest disaster, the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Because online news is so fast and easy to acess. People were donating & helping @LOCATION2 just a day after the earthquake happened. The fast response is what is helping @LOCATION2 rebuild from the rubble. Computers provide people with online news & this is definitely beneficial to their lives. Before people starting using computers to research topics & ideas they would use books. They would have to shuffle through piles of pages and articles in newspapers. This is a very inefficient & disorganized way to be research. Now we have the computer. The computer allows you to recall through endless information and topics. It is not possible to an article or essay with information because it will always be in the same place. This allows for guide and efficient research. There are also websites called online databases on the internet. All have to do is type in a keyword or phrase and you have instant research on whatever you wont you wont information on. All this takes time off of research and put it on whatevers else you would wanting to be doing, whether it is writing a paper or doing a presentation.

I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the \"great deals\" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a \"great deal?\" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer.

Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something.

This is an accurate observation, as the essay states that the sign reads \"ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT\" and that the cyclist laughs hopelessly at the absurdity of the situation. However, this point could have been developed further by explaining how the sign's ominous message and the cyclist's dehydrated state heighten his sense of desperation and dread.\n\nSecondly, the response mentions that the first glimpse of the Welch's Juice factory makes the cyclist feel excited. This is a valid observation, as the essay states that the factory comes into view and the cyclist is momentarily elated, believing that his water woes are about to end. Yet, the response could have gone further by putting the significance of the Welch's Juice factory into context. For instance, the essay indicates that the factory is abandoned and has been for quite some time, which renders the cyclist's initial enthusiasm ironic and poignant.\n\nLastly, the response touches upon how the deserted fork in the road causes the cyclist to feel troubled. This observation is likewise rooted in the essay, as the cyclist expresses unease at the idea of taking a shortcut that leads him away from civilization. Again, a more in-depth examination of this fork in the road's symbolism and its relation to the cyclist's emotional journey would have strengthened the response.\n\nOverall, the student's response demonstrates a partial understanding of the text.

However, the response could benefit from more specific information from the excerpt to support the points made.\n\nFirst Obstacle: The student mentions that the Empire State Building's structure needed to be modified to hold a dirigible of 1,000 feet, and the cost of this modification was estimated to be over $60,000. This information is supported by the excerpt, which states that the architects had to modify the steel frame of the building to accommodate the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. However, the student's response does not mention the specifics of the modification, such as the need for strengthening the building's frame or the addition of steel reinforcements.\n\nSecond Obstacle: The student mentions that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which made them flammable. This is a valid concern, as the excerpt states that the Hindenburg disaster made it clear that the use of hydrogen in dirigibles was a significant safety issue. However, the student's response does not elaborate on the potential consequences of a hydrogen-filled dirigible catching fire above a populated area like downtown New York.\n\nThird Obstacle: The student mentions that the mooring mast was affected by the wind, causing the dirigible to swing and making it difficult to tie up to the building. This is supported by the excerpt, which states that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.

The student mentions being patient while waiting for an appointment, but the rest of the response is focused on the events that occurred during the appointment, rather than the idea of patience itself. There are no specific details provided to support the idea of patience, and the response does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept. Therefore, I would score this criterion as 2, as the ideas are not fully developed and could be more focused on the topic.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the response is weak. The student jumps between different ideas and events without a clear connection between them. The response does not have a clear beginning, middle, or end, and it is difficult to follow the student's train of thought. The student could benefit from using transitional phrases to connect ideas and create a clearer structure. Therefore, I would score this criterion as 1, as the organization is weak and could be improved.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's use of language is adequate, but could be improved. The response uses simple sentences and lacks variety in sentence structure. The student could benefit from using more descriptive language and varied sentence structures to make the response more engaging and effective. The student also uses some incorrect grammar and punctuation, such as using \"(@CAPS1\" instead of \"Capital One\" and not using commas correctly. Therefore, I would score this criterion as 2, as the student's use of language is adequate but could be improved.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's use of conventions is limited. The response contains several spelling and punctuation errors, such as \"CAPS1\" instead of \"Capital One\", \"apprisiate\" instead of \"appreciate\", and incorrect use of commas. The student could benefit from proofreading the response to correct these errors. Therefore, I would score this criterion as 1, as the student's use of conventions is limited and could be improved.\n\nSCORE: 6/15\n\nOverall, the student's response could be improved in all four criteria. The student could benefit from focusing more on the topic of patience, organizing the response in a clearer structure, using more descriptive language and varied sentence structures, and proofreading to correct errors in conventions.",

Here's my step-by-step review of the student's response:\n\nIdeas:\n\nThe student's response tells a story that is relevant to the topic of patience. The student describes a situation where they had to wait for a long time for their food at a restaurant. The story is simple and lacks specific details that could have made it more engaging. For example, the student could have described the setting, the mood, or the reactions of the people around them. The student also doesn't provide a clear lesson or message about patience, leaving the reader with a vague understanding of the story's purpose.\n\nScore: 4/6\n\nOrganization:\n\nThe student's response has a clear beginning, middle, and end. The student starts by describing their experience of waiting for their food, describes the long wait, and ends with the food finally arriving.

        "marker": " My pleasure, here is the detailed, step-by-step review of the student's response with an in-depth rationale for the grade I assign, referencing the rubric provided:\n \nIdeas:\nThe student's story partially focuses on the topic of patience, depicting their personal experience of being patient on their birthday when they were eager to try riding their bike without training wheels. They provide specific details of their age, the day, and the dialogue between themselves and their family members. However, there is minimal development of the idea of patience in the story, as the narrative mainly revolves around the student's excitement and desire to ride the bike. Therefore, I award 3 out of 6 points for Ideas.\n\nOrganization:\nThe organization of the student's response is weak. The story lacks a clear beginning, middle, and end. The student jumps abruptly into the story without introducing the setting or context, and the ending feels rushed and incomplete. There is no logical sequence of events, and the connections between ideas are not clearly established. I award 1 out of 3 points for Organization.\n\nStyle:\nThe student's writing style does not exhibit a command of language that effectively supports their purpose and audience. The word choice is minimal, with limited variation in sentence structure. The sentences are mostly simple and lack complexity, which makes the narrative feel somewhat choppy. I award 1 out of 3 points for Style.\n\nConventions:\nThe student's response demonstrates a limited understanding of conventions of Standard English. There are errors in grammar, usage, and punctuation. For example, there are incorrect uses of the @ symbol to replace words, inconsistent capitalization, and missing articles. I award 1 out of 3 points for Conventions.\n\nSCORE: 6/15\n\nIn conclusion, the student's response demonstrates some understanding of the topic of patience, but the story lacks development and organization. The writing style does not exhibit a command of language, and conventions are not consistently applied. Considering the rubric, the student's response scores 6 out of 15.",
