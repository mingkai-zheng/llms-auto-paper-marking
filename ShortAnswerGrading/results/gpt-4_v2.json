The standard solution defines a variable as \"a location in memory that can store a value\". The student's response that a variable is \"a symbol that stands in for a value that may or may not change depending on the program\" captures the concept that variables can indeed store values and also that their values could potentially change, which is a core aspect of what makes variables important in programming. The component which mentions that this value can or cannot change depending on the program, adds to the explanation. \n\nWhile the use of the word 'location in memory' is missing, the student's answer still accurately describes what a variable is in the context of programming, demonstrating a good understanding of this concept. Therefore, I would score the response very highly. \n\nSCORE: 4.5/5"
