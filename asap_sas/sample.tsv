4	1	0	0	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3346	2	2	2	"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3862	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
3203	2	3	3	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
