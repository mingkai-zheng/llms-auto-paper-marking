question = '''List and describe three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.'''

gt = '''1. Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.
2. Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
3. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.
5. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.
6. Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.
7. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.
8. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.
9. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.
10. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around liquid droplets as in pinocytosis.
11. Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.'''
