However, this is not an essential piece of information for replicating the experiment, so I will deduct only one point for this. SCORE: 2/3\n2.

Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.\n2. Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n3. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.\n4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.\n5. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.\n6. Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.\n7. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.\n8. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.\n9. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.\n10. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around liquid droplets as in pinocytosis.\n11. Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.\n\nAs we can see, the student's answer does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. Here's a step-by-step evaluation of the student's answer using the provided rubric:\n\n1. Key elements: The student's answer mentions three words that seem to be related to the topic: \"Protien\", \"genes\", and \"gemetes\". However, these words do not accurately convey the key elements of the standard solutions.\n2. Relevance: The student's answer does not directly address any of the key elements of the standard solutions.\n3. Coherence: The student's answer is difficult to understand due to the lack of coherence and context. The words \"Protien\", \"genes\", and \"gemetes\" are not clearly connected to each other, and their meaning is not evident.\n4. Accuracy: The student's answer contains inaccuracies and misconceptions. For example, \"Protien\" should be \"protein\", and \"gemetes\" is not a correct term.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would award the following score:\n\nSCORE: 0/3\n\nThe student's answer does not meet any of the criteria for a score of 3, and contains several inaccuracies and misconceptions. Despite mentioning three words related to the topic, the answer lacks relevance, coherence, and accuracy. Therefore, a score of 0 is the most appropriate.",

Does the student's answer convey the same meaning as the standard solutions?\n\nNo, the student's answer \"THE CELL WALL HELPS KEEP TRACK OF WHAT ENTERS AND LEAVES THE CELL\" does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. The standard solutions list various processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, while the student's answer mentions the cell wall, which is not one of the processes listed in the standard solutions.\n\n2. Are there any key elements of the standard solutions that are present in the student's answer?\n\nYes, there is one key element of the standard solutions that is present in the student's answer, and that is the concept of the cell membrane controlling the movement of substances into and out of the cell. However, the student's answer does not provide any specific details about the processes used by the cell membrane to control this movement.\n\n3. How well does the student's answer explain the concepts compared to the standard solutions?\n\nThe student's answer does not explain the concepts as well as the standard solutions. The standard solutions provide specific details about the different processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, while the student's answer is a general statement that does not provide any specific information about these processes.\n\nRubric Analysis:\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score the student's answer as follows:\n\nScore 0: The student's answer does not convey the same meaning as the standard solutions and does not explain the concepts as well as the standard solutions.\n\nTherefore, the awarded score would be: SCORE: 0/3.",
