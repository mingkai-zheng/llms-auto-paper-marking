The student suggests adding a specific amount of weight and letting the weights stretch the plastics for a longer period of time.

They state that the different plastics started at different lengths, which may have affected the amount of stretching. However, this is not a valid reason to discount the results, as the student did control for this by measuring the initial length of each plastic sample.\n\nScore: 2/3\n\n2. Improvements:\nThe student correctly identifies one way to improve the experimental design, which is to specify the weights used in the clamps.

The cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell. Liquids pass through the membrane easily.\"\n\nStandard Solutions:\n\n\"1. Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.\n2. Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n3. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.\n4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.\n5. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.\n6. Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.\n7. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.\n8. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.\n9. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.\n10. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around liquid droplets as in pinocytosis.\n11. Protein channels or channel proteins allow for the movement of specific molecules or substances into or out of the cell.\"\n\nAs we can see, the student's answer does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. Here's a breakdown of the student's answer and how it compares to the standard solutions:\n\nStudent Answer:\n\n* \"The cell membrane does not allow all things in the cell.\" - This statement is partially true, as the cell membrane does not allow all substances to pass through freely. However, the student does not mention the specific processes used by cells to control the movement of substances.\n* \"The cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell.\" - This statement is incorrect. The cytoplasm does not slow the movement of substances through the cell, as the cell membrane controls the movement of substances.\n* \"Liquids pass through the membrane easily.\" - This statement is partially true, as some liquids can pass through the cell membrane easily through the process of osmosis. However, the student does not mention the specific process of osmosis or the fact that other substances may not pass through the membrane easily.\n\nAssessment:\n\nBased on the provided rubric, I would score this answer as a 1/3, as it does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. The student's answer is incomplete and inaccurate in several places. Specifically, the student does not mention any of the specific processes used by cells to control the movement of substances, such as selective permeability, passive transport, facilitated diffusion, active transport, or membrane-assisted transport. Additionally, the student's statement about the cytoplasm slowing the movement of substances through the cell is incorrect.\n\nSCORE: 1/3 (one out of three key elements)",

However, these concepts do not specifically address the movement of substances across the cell membrane, which is thefocus of the question. Therefore, the student's answer does not meet the criteria for a score of 3.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the student's answer for two key elements.\n\nThe student's answer mentions one concept from the list of standard solutions: cellular respiration. This concept is not directly related to the movement of substances across the cell membrane, but it is a correct term related to cellular processes. Therefore, the student's answer meets the criteria for a score of 2.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the student's answer for one key element.\n\nThe student's answer mentions the term \"Krebs Cycle,\" which is not a key element from the list of standard solutions. The Krebs Cycle is a metabolic pathway that occurs within the cell, but it is not related to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Therefore, the student's answer does not meet the criteria for a score of 1.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the student's answer for other elements.\n\nThe student's answer does not mention any other elements from the list of standard solutions. Therefore, the student's answer does not meet the criteria for a score of 0.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the student's answer meets the criteria for a score of 2 because it mentions one correct concept related to cellular processes, but it does not specifically address the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nSCORE: 2/3 (two out of three key elements)",
