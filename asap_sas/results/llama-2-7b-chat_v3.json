However, the student's answer lacks clarity and specifically refers to \"Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D.\" (Emphasis added)\nThis is a minor mistake as the student is essentially stating the same conclusion as the standard solutions. However, it is essential for the student to provide more detailed and accurate information to support their conclusion.\n(b) Describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results:\nThe student has identified two ways the experiment could have been improved, which is a good effort. They state that \"Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.\" (Emphasis added)\nWhile these are valid points, the student's answers lack specificity and detail. For instance, the student does not provide any specific examples or explanations of how the tape length or weight addition could have affected the experiment's results. Additionally, the student does not explain how addressing these potential sources of error could have improved the validity of the results.\nRubric Evaluation:\nBased on the student's answer and the provided rubric, I will assign the following score:\nSCORE: 2/3\nThe student has demonstrated an understanding of the experiment and its results, but their answer lacked specificity and detail in some areas. They have identified valid areas for improvement, but these improvements are not detailed enough to provide a comprehensive assessment of the experiment's validity. Therefore, a score of 2 out of 3 is awarded.",

The student's failure to include mRNA translation, correctly identify the role of tRNA, and provide a clear explanation of the role of rRNA undermines their overall assessment of protein synthesis.",

Misconception of protein synthesis: The student describes the process of protein synthesis as the mRNA attaching itself to a codon strand, which is not a correct representation of the process. Instead, the mRNA travels to the ribosome, where tRNA molecules read the codons on the mRNA and bring amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain (Standard Solution 5).\n4.
