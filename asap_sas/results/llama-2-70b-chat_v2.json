Liquids pass through the membrane easily.\"\n\nWhen compared to the standard solutions, the student's answer only partially addresses the question. The student's answer does not mention any specific processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nThe student's statement about the cell membrane not allowing all things in the cell touches on the concept of selective permeability, which is mentioned in standard solution 1. However, the student's explanation is quite vague and does not provide any specific details about how selective permeability works.\n\nThe student's comment about the cytoplasm slowing the movement of things through the cell does not relate to any of the processes listed in the standard solutions. It appears that the student may have misunderstood the question or has some misconceptions about the role of the cytoplasm in cellular processes.\n\nThe student's statement that liquids pass through the membrane easily is partially accurate, as facilitated diffusion, which is mentioned in standard solution 4, does involve the movement of molecules through the cell membrane with the help of transport proteins. However, the student's statement does not specify that this process occurs through transport proteins, and therefore, it does not fully address the question.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, the student's answer does not meet the criteria for a score of 3, as it does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. The student's answer only partially addresses the question and lacks specific details about the processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nTherefore, I would give the student a score of 1, as their answer only vaguely touches on one key element (selective permeability) but does not provide any specific details or examples.\n\nSCORE: 1/3",

The student's answer only contains three terms that are related to cellular biology, but they do not specifically address the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nThe first term, \"Krebs Cycle,\" refers to a metabolic process that occurs within the mitochondria of cells and is unrelated to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The second term, \"Cellular respiration,\" is a broader term that encompasses various metabolic processes within cells, including the Krebs Cycle, but again, it does not specifically address the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
