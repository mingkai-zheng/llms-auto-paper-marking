This matches the standard solution conclusion that plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics. The answer also mentions that plastic A has the least stretchability, although it does not provide the specific value.\n\nRegarding the improvements to the experimental design and validity of the results, the answer suggests two ways. First, it suggests having a 3rd trial, which aligns with one of the standard solution suggestions of performing additional trials. However, the answer does not provide a reason why additional trials would be beneficial. Secondly, the answer suggests using the same length for each sheet or plastic, which corresponds to the standard solution's suggestion of providing before and after measurements for length to ensure that all samples started out the same size.\n\nIn summary, the student's answer draws a valid conclusion supported by the data and describes two ways to improve the experimental design and validity of the results, although it lacks some specific details.

However, genes are not directly involved in controlling the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Genes contain instructions for the synthesis of proteins, which may be involved in some of the processes described in the standard solutions, but simply mentioning \"genes\" without any further explanation or connection to the topic does not meet the criteria for any of the processes mentioned in the standard solutions.\n\nLastly, the student mentions \"gemetes\" (probably meant to be gametes). However, gametes are reproductive cells involved in sexual reproduction and are not directly involved in the control of substance movement across the cell membrane. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for any of the processes mentioned in the standard solutions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the student's answer does not accurately describe any of the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. \n\nSCORE: 0/3",

The student's answer states that \"The cell membrane does not allow all things in the cell,\" which is similar to the first process mentioned in the standard solutions (selective permeability) but does not fully describe it. Therefore, this element can be considered partially correct.\n\n2. The student's answer mentions that \"The cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell,\" which is not mentioned in the standard solutions. This element is not correct because the cytoplasm plays a different role in controlling the movement of substances compared to the cell membrane.\n\n3. The student's answer states that \"Liquids pass through the membrane easily,\" which is similar to the third process mentioned in the standard solutions (osmosis) but does not fully describe it. Therefore, this element can be considered partially correct.\n\nBased on the rubric, the student's answer contains two key elements (element 1 and element 3).

        "marker": "The student's answer compares rather well to the standard solutions. They correctly mention three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, which aligns with the expectations for a score of 3 on the rubric. However, the student's answer lacks the specificity and clarity present in the standard solutions.\n\nIn the first point, the student states, \"Cells use diffusion to let substances permeate its membrane.\" This is somewhat accurate, but it does not fully convey the process of passive transport or diffusion as described in the standard solutions. The student should have explicitly mentioned that the substances move from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration.\n\nIn the second point, the student states, \"Cells use facilitated diffusion or use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.\" This is partially correct, as facilitated diffusion is mentioned in the standard solutions, but the student fails to mention the concept of passive transport or that substances move from an area of higher concentration to lower concentration. Additionally, the use of the word \"pass\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted as passive transport, but it lacks clarity.\n\nIn the third point, the student states, \"Cells use passive diffusion or don't use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.\" This is similar to the second point and suffers from the same lack of clarity and specificity.\n\nBased on this assessment, I would assign a score of 2 to the student's answer. While they correctly identify three processes used by cells, their understanding of these processes is not clear and lacks the specificity outlined in the standard solutions.\n\nSCORE: 2/3",

The phrase \"diffusion against the concentration gradient\" accurately conveys the meaning of active transport, which involves the movement of substances from an area of low concentration to high concentration (or against the concentration gradient). \n\nThe second point about passive transport is also aligned with the standard solution.

The student mentions \"The random movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration\", which describes diffusion. However, diffusion is a broader concept that includes the movement of particles in any direction (not only from high to low concentration) and is not specific to the cell membrane.\n\nBased on this analysis, the student's answer includes three key elements that match the standard solutions, earning a score of 3 on the rubric. \n\nSCORE: 3/3",
