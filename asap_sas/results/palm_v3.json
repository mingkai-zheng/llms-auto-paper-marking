Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied into RNA. The RNA transcript is then used to direct the synthesis of a protein.\n\n2. **Translation**\n\nThe student correctly states that translation is the second step in protein synthesis. Translation is the process by which the RNA transcript is translated into a protein. The RNA transcript is read in triplets called codons. Each codon codes for an amino acid. The amino acids are then linked together to form a protein.\n\n3. **Replication**\n\nThe student incorrectly states that replication is the third step in protein synthesis. Replication is the process by which DNA is copied. It is not a step in protein synthesis.\n\n4. **Exit of mRNA from the nucleus**\n\nThe student does not mention that the mRNA must exit the nucleus before it can be translated into a protein.

In this step, DNA is used as a template to create a molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein.\n\nThe translation of mRNA into a protein takes place on ribosomes. Ribosomes are made up of two subunits, a large subunit and a small subunit. The mRNA is threaded through the ribosome, and the ribosome reads the codons on the mRNA three at a time. Each codon codes for an amino acid.\n\nThe amino acids are brought to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. Each tRNA molecule has an anticodon that is complementary to the codon on the mRNA. The tRNA attaches to the codon on the mRNA, and the amino acid is added to the growing polypeptide chain.\n\nThe translation of the mRNA continues until a stop codon is reached. A stop codon is a codon that does not code for an amino acid. When a stop codon is reached, the translation process stops and the polypeptide chain is released.\n\nThe protein is then folded into its final shape and is ready to carry out its function.\n\nThe student's answer does not mention any of these steps.

They can act as channels, allowing specific molecules to pass through the membrane. They can also act as pumps, using energy to move molecules against a concentration gradient.\n* **Selective permeability:** The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning that it allows some molecules to pass through while blocking others.

Glucose is a large molecule, so it cannot pass through the cell membrane on its own. Instead, the cell uses a protein channel called GLUT-1 to transport glucose into the cell.

This is important because it allows the cell to maintain a stable internal environment.\n* Passive transport is the movement of substances across the cell membrane without the use of energy. This happens when there is a concentration gradient, which is when there is a higher concentration of a substance on one side of the membrane than the other. Substances will always move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\n* Active transport is the movement of substances across the cell membrane against a concentration gradient. This requires energy, which is provided by ATP. Active transport is used to move substances into the cell that are needed but are not present at a high enough concentration, such as glucose.\n\nThese three processes allow cells to control the movement of substances in and out of the cell.

Selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.\n2. Passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\n3. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.\n4. Facilitated diffusion occurs when the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell.\n5. Active transport occurs when a cell uses energy to move a substance across the cell membrane, and/or a substance moves from an area of low to high concentration, or against the concentration gradient.\n6. Pumps are used to move charged particles like sodium and potassium ions through membranes using energy and carrier proteins.\n7. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when the membrane of the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane forcing large molecules out of the cell as in exocytosis.\n8. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when molecules are engulfed by the cell membrane as in endocytosis.\n9. Membrane-assisted transport occurs when vesicles are formed around large molecules as in phagocytosis.\n10.
