A control is a test that is performed under identical conditions to the experimental test, except that the variable being tested is not present. In this case, the control could be a sample of each material that is not placed in vinegar. This would allow the students to compare the mass of the materials before and after exposure to vinegar, and to determine whether the change in mass is due to the vinegar or to other factors.\n2.

Water moves from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration, through a semipermeable membrane.

This is important because it allows the cell to control what substances enter and leave the cell.\n\nActive transport is the movement of substances across the cell membrane against the concentration gradient, which requires energy. This is important because it allows the cell to move substances into or out of the cell even when the concentration of those substances is higher outside the cell than inside the cell.\n\nFacilitated diffusion is the movement of substances across the cell membrane down the concentration gradient, but through a channel protein. This is important because it allows the cell to move substances across the membrane more quickly than if they were to diffuse through the membrane on their own.\n\nThese three processes allow cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane and to maintain homeostasis, which is a state of internal balance.",

The student simply states that the cell wall helps keep track of what enters and leaves the cell.

The cell wall provides support and protection for the cell. It also helps to keep the cell's shape.\n\nHowever, the cell wall does not play a role in controlling the movement of substances across the cell membrane. This is the job of the cell membrane. The cell membrane is a thin, flexible structure that surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. It is made up of lipids and proteins. The cell membrane controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell.\n\nThere are two types of transport across the cell membrane: passive transport and active transport.
