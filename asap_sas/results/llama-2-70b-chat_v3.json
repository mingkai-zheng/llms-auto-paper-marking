The standard solutions, however, suggest \"what type of container to use\" along with the size and surface area of the materials.\n\nGiven that the student's answer partially aligns with the standard solutions, it is reasonable to deduct points for the lack of specificity and clarity.

The student's answer does not mention any specific processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, nor does it describe the processes in detail.\n\nTherefore, based on the rubric provided, the student's answer would receive a score of 0, as it does not meet any of the key elements specified in the rubric. The student's answer does not demonstrate an understanding of the concept of cellular transport processes, and it does not provide any relevant examples or descriptions of the processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nSCORE: 0/3",

The student's answer contains some related ideas, but they are not accurately described and do not constitute a key element. Therefore, the score is 1.\n\nSCORE: 1/3.\n\nJustification:\n\nThe student's answer does not show a clear understanding of the processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The student mentions protein, genes, and gemetes, but these are not the same as the processes described in the standard solutions. The student's answer seems to be a combination of related ideas and misconceptions, which do not accurately convey the same meaning as the standard solutions.

The student's answer does not mention selective permeability, passive transport, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport, pumps, or membrane-assisted transport.\n\nThe student's answer only mentions the cell wall, which is not directly related to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The cell wall is a rigid layer outside the cell membrane that provides structural support and protection to the cell. While it may indirectly affect the movement of substances by providing a physical barrier, it is not a direct factor in the processes listed in the question.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided rubric, I would score the student's answer as follows:\n\nSCORE: 0/3\n\nThe student's answer does not include any of the three key elements listed in the standard solutions, and it does not demonstrate an understanding of the processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.",

While this process does involve the movement of substances across cell membranes, it is not directly related to the three processes asked for in the question.\n\nThe second term, \"Cellular respiration,\" is a broader term that encompasses various processes by which cells generate energy.

        "marker": " The student's answer is as follows:\n\n\"Active transport- diffusion against the concentration gradient. Passive transport- diffusion along the concentration gradient. Diffusion- The random movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration.\"\n\nWhen comparing the student's answer to the standard solutions, we can see that the student has provided three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. However, there are some inaccuracies and missing information in the student's answer that need to be addressed.\n\nThe first process mentioned by the student is \"active transport- diffusion against the concentration gradient.\" While the student has correctly identified active transport as a process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane, the explanation provided is not entirely accurate. Active transport refers to the process by which cells use energy to move substances across the cell membrane, often against the concentration gradient. The student's explanation suggests that diffusion against the concentration gradient is the same as active transport, which is not entirely correct.\n\nThe second process mentioned by the student is \"passive transport- diffusion along the concentration gradient.\" This explanation is partially accurate, as passive transport does involve the movement of substances down their concentration gradient, without the use of energy. However, the student's explanation does not specifically mention the different types of passive transport, such as facilitated diffusion, osmosis, and filtration.\n\nThe third process mentioned by the student is \"diffusion- The random movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration.\" This explanation is accurate, as diffusion does refer to the random movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. However, the student's explanation does not specifically mention the role of the cell membrane in controlling the movement of substances during diffusion.\n\nBased on the provided rubric, the student's answer would receive a score of 2, as they have provided two key elements: active transport and passive transport. However, the student's explanation of active transport is not entirely accurate, and they have not specifically mentioned the different types of passive transport. Additionally, the student's explanation of diffusion does not fully address the role of the cell membrane in controlling the movement of substances.\n\nSCORE: 2/3",
