        "marker": "The student's answer does not accurately convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. The standard solutions provide a detailed description of various processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The student's answer, on the other hand, simply states that the cell wall helps keep track of what enters and leaves the cell.\n\nAccording to the rubric, to earn a score of 3, the student's answer should have included three key elements. However, the student's answer only includes one key element, which is the cell wall. Therefore, the student's answer falls into the \"Score 1\" category.\n\nJustification for the score:\n\nThe student's answer only mentions the cell wall. While the cell wall is an important component of plant cells and has roles in support and protection, it does not directly control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The processes described in the standard solutions, such as selective permeability, passive transport, osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport, pumps, and membrane-assisted transport, are not mentioned by the student.\n\nSCORE: 1/3",

        "marker": "The student's answer does not precisely convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. Let's evaluate each element of the student's answer in comparison to the standard solutions:\n\n1. \"The cell membrane does not allow all things in the cell.\"\nThis statement partially aligns with the first process described in the standard solutions - selective permeability. However, the student's answer does not explicitly mention that the cell membrane allows certain substances to move across. Hence, this element does not fully match the standard solution. Score: 1/3.\n\n2. \"The cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell.\"\nThis element does not align with any of the processes described in the standard solutions. The cytoplasm's role in slowing down movement is not specifically related to the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Therefore, this element does not match any of the standard solutions. Score: 0/3.\n\n3. \"Liquids pass through the membrane easily.\"\nThis statement partially aligns with the process of osmosis described in the standard solutions. However, osmosis is specifically the diffusion of water across the cell membrane, and the student's answer does not mention water explicitly. Therefore, this element does not fully match the standard solution. Score: 1/3.\n\nConsidering the individual assessments of each element, the student's answer receives a total score of 2 out of 9, which corresponds to a score of 2 out of a maximum of 3 according to the rubric.\n\nSCORE: 2/3.",

In the student's answer, they mention \"diffusion\" but do not specifically mention \"selective permeability\". Therefore, the student's answer is missing this key element.\n\nIn the standard solution, the student's answer accurately mentions \"facilitated diffusion\" which is a process where the membrane controls the pathway for a particle to enter or leave a cell. This is the second key element, and the student's answer conveys this idea correctly.\n\nIn the standard solution, the student's answer accurately mentions \"passive diffusion\" which is a process where substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This is the third key element, and the student's answer conveys this idea correctly.\n\nOverall, the student's answer accurately conveys two out of the three key elements described in the standard solutions.

        "marker": "The student's answer includes three key elements that align with the standard solutions:\n\n1. Active transport - The student correctly states that active transport is the movement of substances against the concentration gradient. This matches with the standard solution of active transport, where energy is used to move substances from an area of low to high concentration or against the concentration gradient.\n\n2. Passive transport - The student mentions that passive transport is the movement of substances along the concentration gradient. This is consistent with the standard solution of passive transport, where substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without requiring energy.\n\n3. Diffusion - The student describes diffusion as the random movement of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration. Although the student's definition is quite basic, it aligns with the standard solution of passive transport, where diffusion is one of the types of passive transport.\n\nBased on the rubric, the student's answer covers three key elements, so the score for this answer is 3/3. \n\nSCORE: 3/3",
