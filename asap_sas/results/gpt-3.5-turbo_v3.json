        "marker": "The student's answer does not accurately convey the same meaning as the standard solutions. \n\nThe first element in the student's answer is \"Protien,\" which seems to refer to the term \"protein\" mentioned in the standard solutions. However, it is not clear how the student intends to connect this to the control of movement of substances across the cell membrane. Since the student does not provide a description or explanation, this element cannot be considered as accurate.\n\nThe second element in the student's answer is \"genes.\" While genes are indeed involved in controlling cellular processes, they are not directly related to the control of the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Therefore, this element also cannot be considered as accurate.\n\nThe third element in the student's answer is \"gemetes.\" It is unclear what the student means by this term, as it is misspelled and does not seem to relate to the topic of controlling the movement of substances across the cell membrane. This element cannot be considered as accurate.\n\nBased on the rubric, the student's answer does not demonstrate any of the key elements from the standard solutions.

        "marker": "The student's answer does not accurately convey the same meaning as the standard solutions.\n\nThe first element in the standard solutions is \"selective permeability is used by the cell membrane to allow certain substances to move across.\" The student's answer does address this concept by stating that \"The cell membrane does not allow all things in the cell.\" However, the student's answer lacks the explanation of selectively allowing certain substances to pass through the membrane. Thus, the student's answer is missing a key element.\n\nThe second element in the standard solutions is \"passive transport occurs when substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.\" The student's answer vaguely mentions that \"the cytoplasm slows the movement of things through the cell.\" Although the student mentions a movement of substances, they do not explicitly describe passive transport or the concentration gradient. Therefore, the student's answer is missing a key element.\n\nThe third element in the standard solutions is \"osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.\" The student's answer vaguely mentions that \"liquids pass through the membrane easily.\" While this statement touches upon the concept of osmosis, it is not specifically mentioned and lacks an accurate explanation.

        "marker": "The student's answer provides some accurate information but is not as comprehensive or clear as the standard solutions. Let's evaluate each element one by one:\n\n1. The student mentions diffusion as one of the processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. This aligns with the standard solution of passive transport, where substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. However, the student's statement is not entirely accurate because diffusion alone does not necessarily involve the cell controlling the movement of substances. It should be noted that diffusion is a type of passive transport, but the student did not explicitly mention this. \n\n2. The student mentions facilitated diffusion or using energy to help the substance pass through the cell membrane. Facilitated diffusion is mentioned in the standard solutions, but it is not the same as using energy. The student's statement is unclear and does not accurately convey the process described in the standard solution of active transport.\n\n3. The student mentions passive diffusion or not using energy to help the substance pass through the cell membrane. This is similar to the student's second point and also does not accurately convey the process described in the standard solution of active transport.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the student's answer includes a mix of accurate and inaccurate information, but it is not as comprehensive as the standard solutions. \n\nSCORE: 1/3",
