It is possible that plastic sample A is stronger because it is thicker than plastic sample B. Additionally, the student does not consider the possibility that there may be other factors that could affect the stretchability of the plastic, such as the type of plastic or the temperature.\n\n* In the second part of the question, the student is asked to describe two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results. The student correctly identifies that the student could have increased the time from 5 minutes to 10 minutes and increased the number of trials with each sample. However, the student does not consider the possibility that the student could have used different types of weights or that the student could have used different temperatures.\n\nOverall, the student's answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing more explanation and considering additional factors that could affect the results.\n\nGiven the rubric, the student's answer would receive a score of 2 out of 3.

However, the student does not provide enough explanation to support the conclusion and does not consider all of the possible factors that could affect the results.",

Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build proteins from amino acids. It takes place in two steps: transcription and translation.\n\nTranscription is the process by which DNA is copied into RNA. RNA is a molecule that is similar to DNA, but it has a single strand instead of a double strand. The RNA that is produced during transcription is called messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm.\n\nTranslation is the process by which the information encoded in mRNA is used to build a protein. The ribosome is a protein-making machine that reads the mRNA codon by codon. A codon is a triplet of nucleotides that codes for an amino acid. The ribosome attaches to the mRNA and moves along it, one codon at a time. As it moves, it brings in tRNAs that carry the corresponding amino acids. The tRNAs are matched to the codons on the mRNA by complementary base pairing. The amino acids are then linked together by peptide bonds to form a protein.\n\nThe student's answer does not mention any of the steps of protein synthesis.

Instead, they mention the cytoplasm, flagellum, and the shape of the substances. These are not key elements in the process of movement of substances across the cell membrane.\n\nTherefore, I would award the student a score of 0/3.\n\nHere are some additional details about the three key elements:\n\n* **Selective permeability** is the ability of the cell membrane to allow certain substances to pass through while blocking others. This is important because it allows the cell to control the composition of its cytoplasm.\n* **Passive transport** is the movement of substances across the cell membrane without the use of energy. This occurs when there is a concentration gradient, which is a difference in the concentration of a substance across the membrane. Substances will always move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.\n* **Osmosis** is a type of passive transport that specifically refers to the movement of water across a membrane. Water always moves from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration.\n\nI hope this information is helpful!",
