If 'strength' is accepted as equal to 'resistance to stretch', which is not the same as 'stretchability' stated in the standard solution but is truthfully the opposite of stretchability, the student has made a correct interpretation of the data for conclusion. Hence, I would consider this as a reasonable answer.\n\nFor ways the student could have improved the experiment, the student provided more than two valid suggestions: testing a control for comparison and making the procedure clearer by specifying the sizes and locations of the weights, which align with the reasoning in the standard solution. These are valid critiques and improvements for any experiment, which aligns with solutions listed in the standard responses: provide the before and after measurements and specify the number of weights in each trial.\n\nJustification:\n\nThe student provided a valid conclusion that holds true with the standard solution if we accept 'strength' as 'resistance to stretch'. The student also provided two valid improvements to the experimental design addressing the same concerns as the standard solutions.\n\nBased on the rubric, the student both provided a valid conclusion and proposed two valid improvements of the experimental design/the validity of the results.\n\nThus, the awarded score would be: SCORE: 3/3.",
