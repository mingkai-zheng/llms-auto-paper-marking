While these are important elements in designing an experiment, they do not directly address the question's requirement for the specific details involved in replicating the experiment.\n\nStill, the student does identify a need to specify the type of material to be tested, aligning somewhat with one point from the standard solution (\"3. You need to know what materials to test.\")\n\nIf we interpret the student's answer in a more nuanced manner, we can somewhat equate their suggestion for providing a clear process for each sample (marble, limestone, etc.) with the standard solution's point of needing to know the size/surface area of each material.

While the student does reference that mRNA leaves the nucleus and engages with tRNA and rRNA, they miss out on many of the intermediate and vital steps involved in protein synthesis. They have failed to explicitly mention the roles of the cytoplasm and ribosome, the reading of mRNA bases in triplets known as codons, the recognition of complementary codons via anticodons, the attachment of corresponding amino acids, the inclusion of new amino acids, and importantly, the final formation of a protein through the initiation and termination at START and STOP codons. Furthermore, the student incorrectly suggests that mRNA is sent directly from the nucleus to the tRNA.\n\nGiven this, the student has touched on only two key elements required in the question: the exit of mRNA from the nucleus and the interaction with tRNA and rRNA. Hence, according to the rubric, the student fits the score 1 category.\n\nSCORE: 1/3",
